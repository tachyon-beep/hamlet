# Task: Analyze Training Subsystem

## Context
- **Workspace:** `archeologist_archive/`
- **Read:** `01-discovery-findings.md` (holistic assessment)
- **Write to:** `02-subsystem-catalog.md` (append your section)

## Scope
Analyze the **Training** subsystem located in `src/townlet/training/`

## Expected Output
Follow the EXACT contract specified in the `analyzing-unknown-codebases` skill.

## Validation Criteria
- [ ] All contract sections complete
- [ ] Confidence level marked with reasoning
- [ ] Dependencies bidirectional
- [ ] Output appended to `02-subsystem-catalog.md`
- [ ] NO extra sections added

## Analysis Focus
- Document replay buffer implementations (standard, sequential for LSTM)
- Identify checkpoint utilities (save/load logic)
- Map training state management
- Document TensorBoard logging integration
- Analyze batch sampling strategies
