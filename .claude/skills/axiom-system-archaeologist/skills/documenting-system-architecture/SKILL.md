# Documenting System Architecture

The document provides comprehensive guidance on synthesizing architecture artifacts into professional reports.

## Core Concept
"Synthesize information into insights. Poor reports concatenate source documents" rather than creating coherent narratives.

## Required Report Sections
The structure includes front matter, table of contents, executive summary (2-3 paragraphs), system overview, embedded diagrams with analysis, subsystem catalog entries, key findings, and appendices covering methodology and assumptions.

## Synthesis Strategies

**Pattern Identification**: Examine multiple subsystems for recurring themes (like dependency injection across services), then document which systems use each pattern alongside benefits and trade-offs.

**Concern Extraction**: Elevate issues from catalog entries into a dedicated findings section with severity ratings, impact analysis, and prioritized remediation steps.

**Recommendation Structure**: Group suggestions by timeline (immediate, short-term, long-term) with specific actions rather than vague guidance.

## Cross-Referencing
The document emphasizes bidirectional links between subsystems, diagrams, and findings, recommending 20+ table-of-contents entries and 40+ cross-references for effective navigation.

## Multi-Audience Design
Different readers need different entry points—executives need only the summary, architects need system overview plus diagrams, engineers need technical subsystem details, and operations needs concerns with remediation guidance.

## Success Metrics
Strong reports demonstrate comprehensive synthesis, professional structure with metadata, 2-3 paragraph executive summaries readable standalone, and transparent documentation of confidence levels and assumptions.
