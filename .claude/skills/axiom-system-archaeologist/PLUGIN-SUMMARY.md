# axiom-system-archaeologist Plugin Summary

The axiom-system-archaeologist plugin is a comprehensive development tool featuring five interconnected skills designed to systematically analyze unknown codebases and produce stakeholder-ready architecture documentation.

## Core Architecture

The plugin employs a router-plus-specialist model where a central orchestrating skill coordinates four specialist subagents. As stated in the documentation, the router skill "orchestrates complete architecture analysis workflow by coordinating specialist subagents through structured workspace and document handoffs."

## Two Development Methodologies

The plugin innovatively applies test-driven development in two distinct ways:

**Pattern 1 (Failure-Fixing):** For the router and catalog-generation skills, baseline testing revealed universal contract violations. The development approach addressed these systematically, transforming "100+ failures across 5 pressure scenarios" into perfect compliance.

**Pattern 2 (Excellence-Codification):** For diagram generation, architecture documentation, and validation skills, baseline testing showed no failures—instead revealing sophisticated practices already in use. Rather than fixing problems, this pattern documents and reinforces observed strengths.

## Production Quality

Across 1,560 lines of skill guidance, the plugin demonstrates rigorous testing discipline:
- 10 baseline test runs capturing verbatim agent rationalizations
- 15+ test scenarios specifically designed to expose pressure-induced failures
- Validation checkpoints preventing cascade failures
- Contract-based coordination enabling reliable subagent handoffs

The complete workflow transforms raw codebase exploration into multi-level C4 diagrams, synthesized reports, and validated outputs through five sequential phases.
