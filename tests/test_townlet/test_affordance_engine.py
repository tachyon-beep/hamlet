"""
Test suite for AffordanceEngine - config-driven affordance interaction system.

Following TDD: These tests are written BEFORE implementation.
Tests will fail initially, then pass as we build affordance_engine.py.

Test Coverage:
1. Instant interactions (Shower, HomeMeal)
2. Multi-tick interactions (Bed, Job)
3. Operating hours masking
4. Cost application (deducted before effects)
5. Completion bonuses
6. Integration with vectorized environment
