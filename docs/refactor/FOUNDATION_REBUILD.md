# Foundation Rebuild Plan

**Date**: November 1, 2025  
**Purpose**: Fix damage, break down god classes, create clean slate for future thinking

---

## üéØ Mission

**NOT**: Prepare for Level 3-5 implementation (that's later)

**IS**:

- Get Level 2 POMDP actually working
- Eliminate god classes and antipatterns
- Remove 240+ lines of dead/duplicate code
- Create modular, maintainable, testable codebase
- Clear the mental space to think about future architecture

---

## üìä Current Problems (from ARCHITECTURE.md deep dive)

### God Classes & Antipatterns

1. **vectorized_env.py: 1247 lines** - 8 responsibilities in one file
   - Meter dynamics (150 lines)
   - Reward calculation (280 lines)
   - Observation building (80 lines)
   - Cascade logic (150 lines)
   - Environment stepping
   - Action masking
   - Affordance handling (200-line elif blocks)
   - Agent state management

2. **Code Duplication** - Epsilon-greedy logic copied 3 times
   - exploration/epsilon_greedy.py (100 lines)
   - exploration/rnd.py (100 lines)
   - population/vectorized.py (47 lines)

3. **Dead Code** - 216 lines of disabled experiments
   - COMPLEX_DISABLED reward system (150 lines)
   - Proximity shaping rewards (66 lines)

### Critical Bugs

4. **Level 2 POMDP Broken**
   - Observation dimension mismatch (env produces 53-55, network expects 50)
   - LSTM trained on single transitions with zero hidden state
   - Can't progress to any future features until this works

5. **Hardcoded Configuration**
   - Meter cascades hardcoded (can't experiment)
   - Affordance effects in 200-line elif blocks (can't modify easily)
   - No way to A/B test design changes

## üéØ Why This Solves the Problem

### Addresses God Classes

**Before**: vectorized_env.py does everything (1247 lines)  
**After**: 5 focused modules (each <300 lines)

- RewardStrategy - Calculate rewards
- MeterDynamics - Update meters
- ObservationBuilder - Build observations
- CascadeEngine - Meter relationships
- VectorizedHamletEnv - Orchestration only (~600 lines)

### Eliminates Duplication

**Before**: Epsilon-greedy logic in 3 places (247 lines total)  
**After**: Single shared utility (100 lines)

### Removes Dead Code

**Before**: 216 lines of disabled experiments  
**After**: 0 lines (removed with documentation of what failed)

### Enables Configuration

**Before**: Hardcoded cascades, affordances, penalties  
**After**: YAML configs - change without code edits

### Fixes Critical Bug

**Before**: POMDP broken (observation mismatch, LSTM not learning)  
**After**: Level 2 works (proper sequential training)

## ü§î What Happens After?

### Then (After Phase 4 Complete)

With clean foundation, we can think clearly about:

**Level 4 Architecture**:

- What should multi-agent competition look like?
- How do we model opponent beliefs?
- What's the right game theory abstraction?
- Fresh design, not bolted onto broken code

**Level 5 Architecture**:

- How should emergent communication work?
- What symbols make sense?
- How to ground language in experience?
- Clean slate thinking, not constrained by technical debt

**Research Questions**:

- Can we A/B test cascade designs? (Yes, YAML configs)
- Can we experiment with new reward systems? (Yes, RewardStrategy)
- Can students modify affordances easily? (Yes, YAML affordances)
- Can we profile and optimize? (Yes, modular code)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Principles

**Red-Green-Refactor**: Only refactor with tests green

**One Change at a Time**: Each action keeps tests passing

**No Feature Creep**: NOT preparing for Level 3-5, just cleaning house

**Measure Everything**: Before/after metrics for each phase

**Document Failures**: Keep disabled code as teaching examples (with explanation)

---

## ‚úÖ Success Definition

**Foundation rebuild is complete when**:

1. ‚úÖ Level 2 POMDP works (agent survives 150+ steps with memory)
2. ‚úÖ vectorized_env.py <700 lines (from 1247)
3. ‚úÖ Zero code duplication (single source of truth)
4. ‚úÖ Zero dead code (216 lines removed)
5. ‚úÖ Configuration-driven (cascades & affordances in YAML)
6. ‚úÖ CI/CD automated (ruff, mypy, vulture, pytest)
7. ‚úÖ Test coverage ‚â•70%
8. ‚úÖ 10K episode validation successful
9. ‚úÖ Clear module boundaries (each subsystem < 300 lines)
10. ‚úÖ **Can think clearly about future architecture** ‚Üê MOST IMPORTANT

## üéì The Real Goal

Not just clean code. **Mental clarity.**

Right now:

- POMDP is broken (distracting)
- God classes are overwhelming (can't see structure)
- Dead code is confusing (what's real?)
- Duplication is embarrassing (what's canonical?)
- Hardcoded values are rigid (can't experiment)

After rebuild:

- POMDP works ‚úÖ (one less thing to worry about)
- Clear modules ‚úÖ (easy to understand)
- No clutter ‚úÖ (focus on what matters)
- Single source of truth ‚úÖ (confidence in code)
- Configuration-driven ‚úÖ (easy to experiment)

**Result**: Clean mental space to design Level 4-5 architecture properly.

Not bolting features onto broken foundation.  
Building features on solid, clean, understandable base.
