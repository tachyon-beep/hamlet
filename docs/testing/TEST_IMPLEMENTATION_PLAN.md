# Test Implementation Plan - Red-Green Refactoring

**Created:** October 31, 2025  
**Purpose:** Systematic test implementation before refactoring  
**Target Coverage:** 70-80% on modules being refactored  
**Current Coverage:** 16% (250/1521 statements)

---

## Testing Philosophy

### Goals

1. **Characterization Tests:** Capture current behavior before refactoring
2. **Bug Detection:** Find insidious bugs preventing convergence
3. **Safety Net:** Enable confident refactoring with immediate feedback
4. **Documentation:** Tests serve as executable specifications

### Non-Goals

- Don't test for "correct" strategies (emergent behavior is valuable)
- Don't optimize during testing (find issues first)
- Don't assume code is correct (validate everything)

---

## Risk-Based Priority Matrix

### ğŸ”´ CRITICAL PRIORITY (Week 1)

**Environment Core - Meter Dynamics & Death Conditions**

- **Why First:** Agents not converging suggests bugs in fundamental game rules
- **Risk:** Cascading meter effects may have subtle bugs
- **Impact:** If meters are wrong, everything built on them is wrong

### ğŸŸ¡ HIGH PRIORITY (Week 2)

**Training Loop & Q-Learning**

- **Why Second:** Training may have issues preventing convergence
- **Risk:** DQN updates, replay buffer, gradient flow
- **Impact:** Directly affects learning performance

### ğŸŸ¢ MEDIUM PRIORITY (Week 3)

**Curriculum & Exploration**

- **Why Third:** These adapt based on core systems
- **Risk:** Logic bugs in advancement/annealing
- **Impact:** Affects learning speed, not correctness

## Week 1: Critical Foundation Tests

### Phase 1.1: Meter System Validation (Days 1-2)

#### Test File: `test_meter_dynamics.py`

**Test Suite 1: Base Depletion**

```python
def test_energy_depletes_at_correct_rate()
    # Energy should deplete 0.5% per step
    # Test: 200 steps = 100% depletion (death)
    
def test_hygiene_depletes_at_correct_rate()
    # Hygiene should deplete 0.3% per step
    
def test_satiation_depletes_at_correct_rate()
    # Satiation should deplete 0.4% per step
    
def test_money_does_not_deplete_passively()
    # Money should only change via interactions
    
def test_mood_depletes_at_correct_rate()
    # Mood should deplete 0.1% per step
    
def test_social_depletes_at_correct_rate()
    # Social should deplete 0.6% per step (fastest!)
```

**Test Suite 2: Fitness-Modulated Health Depletion** ğŸš¨ HIGH BUG RISK

```python
def test_health_depletion_with_high_fitness()
    # fitness > 0.7 â†’ health depletes at 0.05% per step
    # Verify multiplier is 0.5x baseline
    
def test_health_depletion_with_medium_fitness()
    # 0.3 â‰¤ fitness â‰¤ 0.7 â†’ health depletes at 0.1% per step
    # Verify baseline rate
    
def test_health_depletion_with_low_fitness()
    # fitness < 0.3 â†’ health depletes at 0.3% per step
    # Verify 3x penalty - BUG SUSPECT: May be too aggressive?
    
def test_fitness_decay_affects_health_over_time()
    # As fitness decays, health depletion should accelerate
    # This creates death spiral - is threshold correct?
```

**Test Suite 3: Cascading Secondary â†’ Primary** ğŸš¨ HIGH BUG RISK

```python
def test_low_satiation_damages_health()
    # satiation < 0.3 â†’ health penalty scales with deficit
    # Formula: 0.004 * deficit (0.4% at threshold, ~0.8% at 0)
    # BUG SUSPECT: Is this too punishing?
    
def test_low_satiation_damages_energy()
    # satiation < 0.3 â†’ energy penalty scales with deficit
    # Formula: 0.005 * deficit (0.5% at threshold, ~1.0% at 0)
    # BUG SUSPECT: Double penalty (satiation + energy) may be excessive
    
def test_low_mood_damages_energy()
    # mood < 0.3 â†’ energy penalty scales with deficit
    # Formula: 0.005 * deficit
    # BUG SUSPECT: Combined with satiation, agent may never recover energy
    
def test_satiation_threshold_is_correct()
    # Verify 0.3 (30%) is the right threshold
    # Below this, cascading effects trigger
    # BUG SUSPECT: May be too high, causing premature death spirals
```

**Test Suite 4: Cascading Tertiary â†’ Secondary** ğŸš¨ MODERATE BUG RISK

```python
def test_low_hygiene_damages_satiation()
    # hygiene < 0.3 â†’ satiation penalty 0.002 * deficit
    # "Being dirty â†’ loss of appetite"

    # hygiene < 0.3 â†’ mood penalty 0.003 * deficit
    # "Being dirty â†’ feel bad"
    
def test_low_social_damages_mood()
    # social < 0.3 â†’ mood penalty 0.004 * deficit

    # Health = 0 â†’ done = True
    
def test_death_when_energy_reaches_zero()
    # Energy = 0 â†’ done = True
    
def test_no_death_from_other_meters_at_zero()
    # hygiene, satiation, mood, social, fitness at 0
    # Should NOT die directly (only via cascading to primaries)
    
def test_death_spiral_from_low_satiation()
    # Start with satiation = 0.2, other meters normal
    # Track steps until death
    # BUG SUSPECT: May die too quickly, making game unwinnable
    
def test_death_spiral_from_low_fitness()
    # Start with fitness = 0.2, other meters normal
    # Health should accelerate to 0
    
def test_combined_cascade_death_spiral()
    # Multiple low meters (satiation + hygiene + social)
    # Should create faster death than single meter
    # Verify cascading is additive not multiplicative
```

**Test Suite 6: Meter Clamping** ğŸš¨ LOW BUG RISK

```python
def test_meters_cannot_exceed_1_0()
    # Apply massive positive benefits
    # Verify all meters clamp at 1.0
    
def test_meters_cannot_go_below_0_0()
    # Apply massive negative effects
    # Verify all meters clamp at 0.0
    
def test_money_cannot_go_negative()

def test_boundary_clamping()
    # Agents at edges should not move beyond grid
    # UP at y=0, DOWN at y=7, etc.
    
def test_movement_resets_interaction_progress()
    # If agent moves away from affordance mid-interaction
    # Progress should reset to 0
```

    # INTERACT should be masked when not standing on affordance
    
def test_interact_masked_when_cannot_afford()
    # INTERACT should be masked when money < cost
    # BUG SUSPECT: Is this check happening correctly?

    # Masked actions should have -inf Q-values
    # Argmax should never select masked actions
```

    # Bed: 5 ticks Ã— 0.075 linear + 0.125 completion = +50% energy
    # Also: +2% health on completion
    # Cost: 5 Ã— $1 = $5 total
    
def test_job_provides_money_and_costs_energy()
    # Job: 4 ticks â†’ $22.50 total, -15% energy, +2% social, -3% health
    # Verify all effects apply correctly
    
def test_park_is_free()
    # Park should cost $0
    # Should provide fitness + social + mood
    # BUG SUSPECT: Is park too good? Makes it dominant strategy?
    
def test_early_exit_preserves_progress()
    # Start interaction, get 3/5 ticks
    # Move away, return
    # Progress should still be 3/5 (or reset - verify current behavior)
    
def test_completion_bonus_only_on_full_completion()
    # Do 4/5 ticks of Bed
    # Should get linear benefits only, NO completion bonus
    
def test_money_charged_per_tick()
    # Not all at once
    # Verify money decreases gradually during interaction
```

## Bug Hypothesis Tracking

As we write tests, track suspected bugs here:

### ğŸš¨ HIGH PRIORITY SUSPECTS

1. **Cascading Meter Penalties Too Aggressive**
   - Hypothesis: Low satiation triggers both health AND energy penalties
   - Combined with moodâ†’energy, agent may be unable to recover
   - Test: `test_death_spiral_from_low_satiation`

2. **Fitness Death Spiral**
   - Hypothesis: Low fitness (< 0.3) causes 3x health depletion
   - May create unrecoverable death spiral
   - Test: `test_health_depletion_with_low_fitness`

3. **Action Masking Not Preventing Invalid Actions**
   - Hypothesis: Masked actions still being selected during exploration
   - Would explain poor learning (agent wasting actions on invalid moves)
   - Test: `test_action_masking_prevents_invalid_actions`

4. **LSTM Not Using History**
   - Hypothesis: Recurrent network may be acting like MLP
   - Hidden state might not be carrying information
   - Test: `test_recurrent_qnetwork_uses_history`

5. **Reward Signal Too Weak**
   - Hypothesis: -100 death penalty dominates +5 century bonus
   - Agent may never see enough positive signal to learn
   - Test: `test_death_penalty` and `test_century_milestone_bonus`
