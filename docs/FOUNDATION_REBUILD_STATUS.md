# Foundation Rebuild - Current Status

**Date**: November 1, 2025  
**Last Updated**: After cleanup detour completion  
**Authority**: Based on FOUNDATION_REBUILD.md, SOFTWARE_DEFINED_WORLD.md, CLEANUP_ROADMAP.md

---

## üéØ Where We Are

We got temporarily sidetracked by project cleanup (configs organization, old checkpoints, etc.) but that's now **COMPLETE**. Time to return to our strategic foundation work!

**Strategic Context**: We're implementing the **v2.0 "Smart Collection" prerequisites** by making the environment data-driven so Module B (World Model) can learn physics from config, not code.

---

## üéØ Current Focus: ACTION #12 (Config-Defined Affordances)

### ACTION #1 Complete! ‚úÖ

**Completed** (Nov 1, 2025):

- ‚úÖ Made CascadeEngine the default in MeterDynamics
- ‚úÖ Created teaching examples (cascades_weak.yaml, cascades_strong.yaml)
- ‚úÖ All 329 tests passing
- ‚úÖ Documentation complete (ACTION_1_COMPLETE.md)
- ‚úÖ Moonshot prerequisite #1 achieved!

### ACTION #12 Progress: TDD Phase Complete! ‚úÖ (40% Done)

**Completed Today** (Nov 1, 2025):

- ‚úÖ Test suite written (34 tests, all passing!)
  - 18 config loading tests (schema validation, YAML loading)
  - 16 engine tests (instant, multi-tick, operating hours, costs)
- ‚úÖ Configuration layer (210 lines, 81% coverage)
  - Pydantic models: AffordanceConfig, AffordanceEffect, AffordanceCost
  - Type-safe YAML loader
  - Schema validation at load time
- ‚úÖ Execution layer (342 lines, 86% coverage)
  - AffordanceEngine with instant & multi-tick interactions
  - Operating hours with midnight wraparound
  - Action masking (affordability + hours)
  - Fully vectorized for GPU
- ‚úÖ Templates created
  - `configs/affordances.yaml` (550 lines) - All 15 affordances defined
  - `configs/cues.yaml` (500 lines) - Template for Level 4+ opponent modeling

**Files Created/Modified**:

1. `tests/test_townlet/test_affordance_config_loading.py` (313 lines)
2. `tests/test_townlet/test_affordance_engine.py` (412 lines)
3. `src/townlet/environment/affordance_engine.py` (342 lines)
4. `src/townlet/environment/affordance_config.py` - Complete rewrite (210 lines)
5. `configs/affordances.yaml` (550 lines) - TEMPLATE
6. `configs/cues.yaml` (500 lines) - TEMPLATE for future

**Total**: ~2,327 lines of new/modified code in 1 day!

**Next Steps** (4-5 days):

1. **Days 1-2**: Equivalence testing (prove AffordanceEngine matches hardcoded logic)
2. **Days 3-5**: Integration with vectorized_env.py (remove 200+ line elif blocks)
3. **Day 6**: Teaching examples (creative/minimal/extreme affordance sets)

**Goal**: Move affordance effects from code to YAML (second moonshot prerequisite)

**Current Problem**: 200+ line elif blocks in environment for affordance effects

**Target State**: `configs/affordances.yaml` defines all affordance effects

**Why**: Enable Module B (World Model) to learn affordance effects from config

## üìã Next Steps After ACTION #1

### Immediate: Commit ACTION #1 Work

```bash
git add configs/bars.yaml configs/cascades.yaml
git add src/townlet/environment/cascade_*.py
git add tests/test_townlet/test_cascade_*.py
git add docs/ACTION_1_*.md
git commit -m "ACTION #1: Configurable Cascade Engine (90% complete)

- YAML configs for bars and cascades (SDW structure)
- CascadeEngine with gradient penalties (our validated math)
- MeterDynamics dual-mode support (config vs hardcoded)
- 44 new tests (23 config + 21 engine), all passing
- 329 total tests passing, 70% coverage maintained

Remaining: Make CascadeEngine default, create teaching examples
"
```

### Then: Return to Critical Path

**Option A: Continue Phase 1 (Fix POMDP)** - CRITICAL PATH ‚ö†Ô∏è

This is the **blocker for Levels 3-5**:

- ACTION #9: Network architecture redesign (3-4 weeks)
- Fix observation dimensions
- Implement proper LSTM training
- Memory validation tests

**Option B: Continue Phase 2 (Config-Defined Affordances)** - MOONSHOT PREREQUISITE üöÄ

This is the **second moonshot prerequisite** after cascades:

- ACTION #12: Configuration-defined affordances (1-2 weeks)
- Move 200-line elif blocks to YAML
- Enable Module B to learn affordance effects

**Recommendation**: **Finish ACTION #1 (2-3 hours) ‚Üí Do ACTION #12 (1-2 weeks) ‚Üí Then ACTION #9 (3-4 weeks)**

**Rationale**:

- Complete the config-driven foundation (both moonshot prerequisites)
- Build momentum with productive work
- Then tackle the harder LSTM problem with full context

## üöÄ Strategic Alignment

**From CLEANUP_ROADMAP.md "North Star":**

> "Our foundation rebuild (ACTIONS #1, #2, #3, #4, #12) is actually **Phase 1 of the moonshot roadmap**. We're not just cleaning‚Äîwe're building the launchpad."

**Status Check:**

- ‚úÖ ACTION #2: RewardStrategy extracted (modular rewards)
- ‚úÖ ACTION #3: MeterDynamics extracted (modular meter system)
- ‚úÖ ACTION #4: ObservationBuilder extracted (pluggable observations)
- üöß ACTION #1: CascadeEngine 90% complete (data-driven physics)
- ‚è≥ ACTION #12: AffordanceConfig not started (data-driven effects)

**We're 80% through the launchpad construction!** üéâ

---

## üîÑ Decision Point

**Question**: Should we finish ACTION #1 (2-3 hours) now, or move to ACTION #9 (POMDP fix)?

**Options**:

1. **Finish ACTION #1 first** (2-3 hours)
   - Pro: Complete one thing before starting another
   - Pro: Get full moonshot prerequisite done
   - Pro: Teaching examples are valuable
   - Con: Delays POMDP fix by 2-3 hours

2. **Jump to ACTION #9 now** (3-4 weeks)
   - Pro: Unblock critical path immediately
   - Pro: POMDP is highest priority
   - Con: Leave ACTION #1 90% done (incomplete work)
   - Con: Miss second moonshot prerequisite

3. **Do ACTION #12 next** (1-2 weeks)
   - Pro: Complete both moonshot prerequisites
   - Pro: Build momentum with productive work
   - Pro: Simpler than ACTION #9 (less risky)
   - Con: POMDP still blocked

**Recommendation**: **Option 1 + 3** - Finish ACTION #1 (2-3 hours), then do ACTION #12 (1-2 weeks), THEN tackle ACTION #9 (3-4 weeks).

**Rationale**: Get all moonshot prerequisites done while building momentum, then attack the hardest problem (LSTM) with full context and energy.

## üìù Summary

**Current State**:

- ACTION #1 is 90% complete and working beautifully
- All 329 tests passing
- 70% coverage achieved
- Ready to make CascadeEngine the default

**Next 2-3 Hours**: Finish ACTION #1 (make default + teaching examples)

**Next 1-2 Weeks**: ACTION #12 (config-defined affordances - second moonshot prerequisite)

**Next 3-4 Weeks**: ACTION #9 (fix POMDP/LSTM - critical path to Levels 3-5)

**Estimated Timeline to Foundation Complete**: 5-7 weeks total (including ACTION #9)

---

**We're making excellent progress! Let's finish what we started (ACTION #1), then complete the moonshot prerequisites before tackling LSTM.** üöÄ
