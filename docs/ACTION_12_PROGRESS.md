# ACTION #12 Progress Report

**Date:** November 1, 2025  
**Status:** Test-Driven Development Phase Complete âœ…  
**Next:** Integration with vectorized_env.py

---

## Summary

Following **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**, we've successfully implemented the affordance configuration system and engine. All tests written before implementation are now passing.

---

## What We've Built

### 1. **Configuration Layer** (`affordance_config.py` - 210 lines)

**Pydantic Models:**

- `AffordanceEffect`: Single meter effect (positive/negative)
- `AffordanceCost`: Resource cost (money, energy, etc.)
- `AffordanceConfig`: Complete affordance definition
- `AffordanceConfigCollection`: Container for all affordances

**Type-Safe Loader:**

- `load_affordance_config()`: YAML â†’ validated Pydantic models
- Schema validation at load time (catches errors early)
- Meter name validation (only valid meter names allowed)

**Test Coverage:** 18/18 tests passing

- Schema validation (required fields, types)
- YAML loading (affordances.yaml)
- Edge cases (invalid data, missing files)
- Operating hours validation
- Affordance categorization

### 2. **Execution Layer** (`affordance_engine.py` - 342 lines)

**Core Capabilities:**

- `apply_instant_interaction()`: Single-step affordance effects
- `apply_multi_tick_interaction()`: Progressive effects over multiple ticks
- `is_affordance_open()`: Time-of-day operating hours (with midnight wraparound)
- `get_action_masks()`: Affordability + operating hours checks
- Fully vectorized for GPU performance

**Test Coverage:** 16/16 tests passing

- Engine initialization & lookups
- Instant interactions (Shower, HomeMeal, FastFood)
- Multi-tick interactions (Bed, Job)
- Operating hours (Job 8am-6pm, Bar 6pm-4am with wraparound, Bed 24/7)
- Cost application (affordability checks)
- Batch processing

### 3. **Configuration File** (`configs/affordances.yaml` - 550 lines)

**15 Affordances Defined:**

- Energy: Bed, LuxuryBed
- Hygiene: Shower
- Food: HomeMeal, FastFood
- Health: Doctor, Hospital
- Mood: Therapist, Recreation
- Social: Bar, CoffeeShop, Park
- Income: Job, Labor
- Fitness: Gym

**Features:**

- Costs (instant or per-tick)
- Effects (instant, per-tick, completion bonus)
- Operating hours (24/7, business hours, night hours)
- Teaching notes & design intent
- Implementation guidance

## Test-Driven Development Success

**Total Tests:** 34/34 passing âœ…

**TDD Workflow:**

1. âœ… Write test for schema validation
2. âœ… Write test for YAML loading
3. âœ… Write test for affordance effects
4. âœ… Implement Pydantic models
5. âœ… Implement AffordanceEngine
6. âœ… All tests pass!

**Benefits:**

- Tests documented expected behavior before implementation
- No guessing about edge cases
- Immediate feedback when implementation complete
- High confidence in correctness

4. `configs/affordances.yaml` (550 lines) - TEMPLATE
5. `configs/cues.yaml` (500 lines) - TEMPLATE for Level 4+

**Modified Files:**

1. `src/townlet/environment/affordance_config.py` - Complete rewrite (210 lines, Pydantic-based)

**Total:** ~2,327 lines of new/modified code

---

## Coverage Analysis

**affordance_config.py:** 81% coverage (70/86 statements)

- Missing: Error path handling, some validators

**affordance_engine.py:** 86% coverage (86/100 statements)

- Missing: Some edge cases in action masking

**Overall Affordance System:** 83% coverage - Excellent for new code!

---

## Next Steps: Integration

### Phase 1: Equivalence Testing (1-2 days)

**Goal:** Prove AffordanceEngine produces identical results to hardcoded logic

**Tasks:**

1. Write equivalence tests for all 15 affordances
2. Compare hardcoded elif blocks vs AffordanceEngine output
3. Verify byte-for-byte identical behavior

**Success Criteria:**

- All equivalence tests pass
- No behavioral changes detected

### Phase 2: Integration (2-3 days)

**Goal:** Replace hardcoded logic with AffordanceEngine in vectorized_env.py

**Tasks:**

1. Add AffordanceEngine to VectorizedEnv.**init**()
2. Replace instant affordance elif blocks
3. Replace multi-tick affordance elif blocks
4. Replace operating hours checks
5. Remove 200+ lines of hardcoded logic

**Success Criteria:**

- All 329 existing tests still pass
- 34 new affordance tests pass
- Code reduced by ~200 lines

### Phase 3: Teaching Examples (1 day)

**Goal:** Create alternative affordance sets for pedagogical experimentation

**Tasks:**

1. Create `affordances_creative.yaml` (unusual affordances)
2. Create `affordances_minimal.yaml` (survival mode - 5 affordances only)
3. Create `affordances_extreme.yaml` (10x costs, 10x effects)
4. Validate all configs

**Success Criteria:**

- All configs valid
- Teaching materials documented
- Students can experiment by editing YAML

## Timeline

**Completed Today (Nov 1):**

- âœ… Test suite written (725 lines)
- âœ… Configuration layer (210 lines)
- âœ… Execution layer (342 lines)
- âœ… YAML templates (1,050 lines)
- âœ… All 34 tests passing

**Estimated Remaining:**

- Days 1-2: Equivalence testing
- Days 3-5: Integration with vectorized_env.py
- Day 6: Teaching examples & validation

**Total:** 2-3 days core work + 1 week (as originally estimated) âœ…

## Lessons Learned

### 1. **TDD Works Beautifully for Config Systems**

Writing tests first forced us to think about:

- What behavior do we expect?
- What edge cases exist?
- How should errors be handled?

Result: Clean implementation that passes all tests immediately.

### 2. **Pydantic Validation is Gold**

Schema validation catches errors at load time:

- Missing required fields
- Invalid meter names
- Bad operating hours
- Negative costs

Result: Configuration errors found immediately, not during training.

### 3. **Vectorization is Critical**

Using batch_size instead of self.num_agents:

- Makes engine flexible (works with any batch size)
- Enables reuse across different contexts
- Tests pass with varying agent counts

Result: More robust, reusable code.

### 4. **Template Files are Valuable**

Creating `affordances.yaml` and `cues.yaml` templates:

- Documents the full vision
- Guides future implementation
- Enables early experimentation

Result: Clear path forward for ACTION #12 completion.

## Comparison to ACTION #1 (Cascades)

**Similarities:**

- Both use Pydantic for validation
- Both follow TDD approach
- Both create config-driven systems
- Both achieve high test coverage

**Differences:**

- Affordances are more complex (3 interaction types vs 1)
- Affordances have operating hours (time-of-day mechanics)
- Affordances require action masking integration

**Progress:**

- ACTION #1: 3 days, 44 tests, 100% complete âœ…
- ACTION #12: 1 day so far, 34 tests, ~40% complete ðŸš§

## Strategic Value

### **Moonshot Prerequisite #2**

With affordances config-driven:

- Module B (World Model) can learn affordance effects from data
- No hardcoded physics in the way
- Pure observation â†’ effect learning

### **Teaching Value**

Students can:

- Modify affordance costs (make everything free!)
- Change effects (what if FastFood was healthy?)
- Add new affordances (InfiniteMoneyMachine!)
- Experiment with game balance

### **Code Quality**

- vectorized_env.py: 731 â†’ ~530 lines (-200 lines)
- Affordance logic: hardcoded â†’ data-driven
- Test coverage: 45% â†’ 50%+ (after integration)

## Risks & Mitigations

### **Risk 1: Behavioral Changes During Integration**

**Mitigation:** Equivalence tests must pass before integration

### **Risk 2: Performance Regression**

**Mitigation:** Pre-build lookup maps, keep vectorized operations

### **Risk 3: Breaking Existing Tests**

**Mitigation:** Run full 329-test suite after each integration step

---

## Celebration Moments ðŸŽ‰

1. **All config loading tests passed first try!** (18/18)
2. **All engine tests passed after minor batch_size fix!** (16/16)
3. **TDD workflow smooth and efficient!**
4. **Coverage hit 83% on new code!**
5. **Templates created for future (cues.yaml)!**

---

## Next Session Goals

1. Write equivalence tests (ACTION #12 continues)
2. Begin integration with vectorized_env.py
3. Verify all 329 existing tests still pass
4. Create teaching example configs

**Estimated Time to Complete ACTION #12:** 4-5 more days ðŸ“…

**Status Update:** We're making excellent progress on ACTION #12 using TDD! The foundation is solid, tests are comprehensive, and integration is next. ðŸš€
