# Example: Toroidal Grid (Pac-Man Style Wraparound)
#
# This substrate demonstrates "wrap" boundary behavior where agents
# wrap around edges to the opposite side (like Pac-Man).
#
# Behavioral differences from standard "clamp" boundary:
#   - No hard walls - agent can exit left edge and appear on right edge
#   - Shortest path may cross edges (wrap distance < straight distance)
#   - Infinite grid feel (no "corners" or "edges")
