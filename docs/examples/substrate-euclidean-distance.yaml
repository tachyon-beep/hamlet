# Example: Euclidean Distance (Diagonal-Aware Proximity)
#
# This substrate demonstrates "euclidean" distance metric where proximity
# calculations consider diagonal distance (L2 norm, straight-line).
#
# Behavioral differences from standard "manhattan" distance:
#   - Diagonal positions are CLOSER than manhattan distance
#   - Proximity calculations more realistic (as the crow flies)
#   - May not match movement mechanics (if only 4-directional movement)
