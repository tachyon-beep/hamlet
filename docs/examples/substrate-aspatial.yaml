# Example: Aspatial Universe (No Positioning)
#
# This substrate demonstrates pure state machine mode where agents have
# NO position and NO navigation. Affordances are available without spatial location.
#
# Reveals core insight: Meters are the TRUE universe - positioning is just an overlay.
#
# Behavioral differences from grid substrate:
#   - No movement actions (UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT disabled)
#   - No navigation planning (all affordances equally accessible)
#   - Pure resource management (energy, health, satiation cycles)
#   - Observation dim: 0 grid + 8 meters + 15 affordances + 4 temporal = 27 dims
