# Cleanup Strategy Summary

**Date**: November 1, 2025  
**Status**: Week 1 COMPLETE! 🎉

## TL;DR

**Current Problem**: Level 2 POMDP is implemented but LSTM doesn't learn effectively (observation mismatch)

**Why It Matters**: Can't build Levels 3-5 (multi-zone, multi-agent, emergent language) on broken foundation

**Solution**: Fix LSTM learning (3 weeks) → Validate (1 week) → Prepare for scale (3 weeks) → Add quality (2 weeks)

**Timeline**: 7-10 weeks to be ready for Level 3 implementation (accelerated!)

**Week 1 Surprise**: Sequential buffer was ALREADY IMPLEMENTED (29 tests passing, 98% coverage) - timeline accelerated by 1+ weeks!

  - Stores complete episodes (not individual transitions)
  - Samples sequences maintaining temporal structure
  - Validates episode structure (observations, actions, rewards, dones)
  - Fully integrated into `population/vectorized.py`
- ✅ **RecurrentSpatialQNetwork** - 234 lines, 11 tests passing
  - Architecture: Vision CNN (128) + Position (32) + Meter (32) + Affordance (32) = 224 dims
  - LSTM: 224 input → 256 hidden → action_dim output
  - Forward pass, hidden state management, gradient flow all verified
- ✅ **Total LSTM Infrastructure**: 29/29 tests passing (18 buffer + 11 network)

**Status**: Infrastructure building phase COMPLETE. Can proceed directly to optimization.

### Weeks 2-4: Optimize LSTM Learning

- 🚧 **Fix observation mismatch** (ACTION #9) - Resolve dimension issues causing poor learning
  - Infrastructure exists and works (29 tests passing)
  - Problem: Observation format mismatch between env and network
  - Solution: Align observation structure, validate temporal learning
  - Target: 150+ step survival (vs ~115 baseline)

### Week 5: Validate

- ⏳ **Multi-day tech demo** (1 week) - 10K episodes, prove LSTM learns effectively

### Weeks 6-7: Prepare for Level 3

- ✅ **Configurable cascades** (2-3 weeks) - COMPLETE! Add 5 new meters easily
- 🎯 **Config-defined affordances** (1-2 weeks) - Add 14+ affordances easily
- 🎯 **Target network** (1-2 days) - Stable training for 5K+ episodes

### Weeks 8-10: Quality (Optional but Recommended)

- 🎨 **Extract environment subsystems** (1-2 weeks) - Maintainability
- 🎨 **CI/CD pipeline** (3-5 days) - Prevent bugs
- 🎨 **Unified demo server** (1-2 weeks) - Better UX

## Why This Order?

**Phase 1 (Fix Foundation)**: Level 2 POMDP must work before Levels 3-5

- Level 3 needs POMDP (partial obs in zones)
- Level 4 needs POMDP (can't see opponent meters)
- Level 5 needs POMDP (communication happens through observation)
- **Status**: Infrastructure DONE (29 tests passing), now optimize learning

**Phase 2 (Validate)**: Don't build on untested foundation

- 1 week validation saves 2-4 weeks debugging later
- Generates teaching materials from real data
- Validates LSTM actually learns temporal patterns

**Phase 3 (Prepare for Scale)**: Level 3 needs infrastructure

- 5 new meters (✅ DONE - configurable cascades complete!)
- 14+ affordances (🎯 TODO - need YAML configs)
- 5000-7000 episodes (🎯 TODO - need target network stability)

**Phase 4 (Quality)**: Add complexity to clean codebase

**Timeline Acceleration**: Sequential buffer discovery saved 1+ weeks. Original 8-12 week estimate now 7-10 weeks.

- Level 3 adds 4 zones, hierarchical policy, transportation
- Better to refactor before adding complexity
- CI/CD prevents bugs as team grows

---

## What Each Level Needs

### Level 1.5 (Current - Working ✅)

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk

**ACTION #9 (LSTM fix)** - Complex, blocks everything

- **Mitigation**: Incremental approach, test each component
- **Fallback**: Simple MLP works (Level 1.5)
- **Budget**: 4-6 weeks not 3-4

### Medium Risk  

**Level 2 performance degrades** - Partial obs is hard

- **Mitigation**: Document as teaching moment
- **Expectation**: 60-70% of full obs performance

### Low Risk

**Multi-day training unstable** - Phase 3 working well

- **Mitigation**: Checkpoint every 100 episodes
- **Monitoring**: Memory usage, graceful shutdown

---

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Success

- Level 2 agent survives 150+ steps (vs ~115 now)
- LSTM remembers 5+ steps back
- Test coverage ≥70%
- Training stable for 3000 episodes

### Phase 2 Success  

- 10K episodes complete
- Intrinsic weight anneals 1.0 → <0.1
- Final survival >200 steps
- Teaching materials generated

### Phase 3 Success

- New meter in <5 min (YAML)
- New affordance in <10 min (YAML)
- Target network improves stability
- Ready for Level 3

### Phase 4 Success

- CI passes
- vectorized_env.py <700 lines (from 1247)
- One-command demo
- Test coverage ≥70%

---

## Decision Points

### Should we skip validation (Phase 2)?

**NO** - 1 week validation saves 2-4 weeks debugging later

### Should we do quality before Level 3?

**YES** - Level 3 adds lots of complexity, need solid foundation

### Should we implement Level 3 before Level 2 is perfect?

**NO** - Fix Level 2 first, it's a dependency

### Should we do all of Phase 3 before starting Level 3?

**MOSTLY** - Do ACTION #1, #12 for sure (direct blockers), can defer #5 if time-constrained

### Next Sprint: Fix LSTM Foundation

### Days 1-5 (1 week)

ACTION #7: Sequential replay buffer

- Store trajectories not transitions
- Enable LSTM training with temporal dependencies

### Days 6-26 (3-4 weeks)

ACTION #9: Network architecture redesign

- Fix observation dimension handling
- Implement proper LSTM training
- Validate temporal learning

**By end of Weeks 2-5**: Level 2 POMDP working properly

---

## Bottom Line

**We're 80% to Level 2, but that last 20% (LSTM) is critical.**

Can't skip to Level 3 without working POMDP - it's a foundation for:

- Level 3: Partial obs in zones
- Level 4: Can't see opponents  
- Level 5: Communication through observation

### Updated Timeline (After Week 1 Success)

**Original Plan**: 8 weeks (4 fixing + 1 validating + 3 preparing)

**Actual Progress**: Week 1 complete with BONUS ACTION #1! 🎉

**Revised Timeline**:

- ✅ Week 1: Quick wins + CascadeEngine (COMPLETE)
- 🚧 Weeks 2-5: Fix LSTM (ACTION #7, #9)
- ⏳ Week 6: Multi-day validation
- 🎯 Weeks 7-8: Prepare for Level 3 (ACTION #12 affordances, #5 target network)
- **Total**: 8 weeks to Level 3 ready (on track!)

**Key Achievement**: CascadeEngine completed early! One less blocker for Level 3. 🚀

**Recommendation**: Proceed with LSTM fix (ACTION #7 → #9), then validate foundation

**Risk**: Budget 10-12 weeks to be safe (ACTION #9 is complex)

**Payoff**: Working POMDP foundation that scales to the exciting stuff (multi-agent, game theory, emergent language)!

## Teaching Value of CascadeEngine

Students can now:

- **Experiment safely**: Edit YAML instead of Python code
- **See interesting failures**: Too weak → death, too strong → can't recover
- **Learn system design**: Data-driven vs hardcoded logic
- **Understand specification gaming**: Reward hacking through meter manipulation
- **Research easily**: Create custom meter configurations for experiments

**Example**: Want to test "what if hunger affected mood instead of health?"

- Before: Modify 50+ lines of Python in 3 methods
- Now: Change 2 lines in cascades.yaml

This is the pedagogical power we're building!

### Alternative Configs Coming Soon (Week 2)

**Planned configurations for student experiments**:

- `configs/cascades/default.yaml` - Current balanced behavior
- `configs/cascades/weak_cascades.yaml` - 50% strength (easier to survive)
- `configs/cascades/strong_cascades.yaml` - 150% strength (hardcore mode)
- `configs/cascades/sdw_official.yaml` - Match original SDW paper (20% thresholds)
- `configs/cascades/level_3_preview.yaml` - 13 meters for future expansion

Students will be able to:

1. Compare agent behavior across different cascade strengths
2. See how specification gaming emerges with weak cascades
3. Study collapse dynamics with strong cascades
4. Validate against published results (SDW paper)
5. Design custom physics for research questions

## Quick Command Reference

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest tests/test_townlet/ -v

# Run cascade tests only
uv run pytest tests/test_townlet/test_cascade_*.py -v

# Run with coverage
uv run pytest tests/ --cov=src/townlet --cov-report=term-missing -v

# Quick test (no verbose)
uv run pytest tests/test_townlet/ -q
```

### Using CascadeEngine

```python
from townlet.environment.meter_dynamics import MeterDynamics

# Legacy mode (default, backward compatible)
md = MeterDynamics(num_agents=10, device=device)

# Config-driven mode (new!)
md = MeterDynamics(num_agents=10, device=device, use_cascade_engine=True)

# Custom config directory
from pathlib import Path
md = MeterDynamics(
    num_agents=10, 
    device=device,
    use_cascade_engine=True,
    cascade_config_dir=Path("configs/custom")
)
```

### Editing Cascade Configs

```yaml
# configs/cascades.yaml - Change cascade strength
cascades:
  - name: "satiation_to_health"
    source: "satiation"
    target: "health"
    category: "primary_to_pivotal"
    strength: 0.004  # Change this! (default: 0.004, range: 0.001-0.010)
    threshold: 0.3   # Below this triggers cascade
```

### Performance Benchmarking

```bash
# Create benchmark script
python scripts/benchmark_cascade_engine.py

# Compare legacy vs config-driven
# Target: <5% overhead
```
