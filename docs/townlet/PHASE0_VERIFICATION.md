# Townlet Phase 0 Verification Checklist

**Date Completed**: 2025-10-29

## DTOs (Cold Path) - Pydantic

- [x] CurriculumDecision
  - [x] Validates difficulty_level ∈ [0, 1]
  - [x] Validates reward_mode ∈ {shaped, sparse}
  - [x] Immutable (frozen=True)
  - [x] Test coverage: 4/4 tests passing

- [x] ExplorationConfig
  - [x] Validates strategy_type ∈ {epsilon_greedy, rnd, adaptive_intrinsic}
  - [x] Validates epsilon ∈ [0, 1]
  - [x] Sensible defaults
  - [x] Test coverage: 4/4 tests passing

- [x] PopulationCheckpoint
  - [x] Validates num_agents ∈ [1, 1000]
  - [x] JSON serialization/deserialization
  - [x] Test coverage: 3/3 tests passing

## Hot Path State - Tensors

- [x] BatchedAgentState
  - [x] Constructs with correct shapes
  - [x] Device transfer with .to()
  - [x] CPU summary extraction
  - [x] batch_size property
  - [x] Test coverage: 4/4 tests passing

## Interfaces (Abstract Base Classes)

- [x] CurriculumManager ABC
  - [x] Cannot instantiate
  - [x] Requires all abstract methods
  - [x] Type-checked with mypy --strict
  - [x] Test coverage: 3/3 tests passing

- [x] ExplorationStrategy ABC
  - [x] Cannot instantiate
  - [x] Requires all abstract methods
  - [x] Type-checked with mypy --strict
  - [x] Test coverage: 3/3 tests passing

- [x] PopulationManager ABC
  - [x] Cannot instantiate
  - [x] Requires all abstract methods
  - [x] Type-checked with mypy --strict
  - [x] Test coverage: 3/3 tests passing

## Code Quality

- [x] All files have docstrings
- [x] mypy --strict passes on all interface files
- [x] Test coverage: 100% on DTOs and interfaces
- [x] All commits follow conventional format

## Commands to Verify

```bash
# Run all Phase 0 tests
pytest tests/test_townlet/test_training/ tests/test_townlet/test_curriculum/test_base.py tests/test_townlet/test_exploration/test_base.py tests/test_townlet/test_population/test_base.py -v

# Verify mypy strict
mypy --strict src/townlet/curriculum/base.py
mypy --strict src/townlet/exploration/base.py
mypy --strict src/townlet/population/base.py

# Check test coverage
pytest --cov=townlet --cov-report=term-missing tests/test_townlet/
```

## Next Steps (Phase 1)

- [ ] VectorizedHamletEnv implementation
- [ ] StaticCurriculum (trivial implementation)
- [ ] EpsilonGreedyExploration (vectorized)
- [ ] VectorizedPopulation (coordinates above)
- [ ] Oracle validation against Hamlet

## Notes

Phase 0 establishes contracts. All future implementations must satisfy these interfaces without API changes.
