# Bar & Social: Mandatory Resource Sink Design

**Date**: 2025-10-28
**Purpose**: Add complexity to prevent "standing around" strategies
**Core Mechanic**: Social meter with ONLY one source (Bar)
**Result**: Agent must engage with expensive, multi-cost affordance

---

## Design Philosophy: Forced Complexity

### The Problem
With 4-5 meters, agents could find "lazy" strategies:
- Optimize subset of meters
- Ignore expensive affordances
- Find equilibrium without full engagement

### The Solution: Mandatory Sink
Add a meter (Social) that:
- **Depletes over time** (like biological needs)
- **Only ONE source** (Bar - can't substitute)
- **That source is expensive** (costs multiple resources)
- **Creates forced trade-offs** (must sacrifice to maintain)

**Result**: Agent MUST engage with entire system. No shortcuts.

---

## New Meter: Social

**File**: `src/hamlet/environment/meters.py`

```python
class Social(Meter):
    """Social meter: depletes over time, ONLY restored by Bar (mandatory sink)."""

    def __init__(self):
        # Starts at 50 (mid-level), depletes faster than bio meters
        super().__init__(name="social", initial_value=50.0, depletion_rate=0.6)
```

**Mechanics**:
- Initial value: 50 (starts moderate)
- Depletion rate: 0.6 per step (faster than energy/satiation)
- **Critical distinction**: ONLY Bar restores social
  - Bed/Shower/Fridge/Job/Recreation: All have ZERO social effect
  - Bar: +50 social (significant boost)

**Reward structure**:
```python
# Social treated like biological meters
if social_normalized > 0.8:
    reward += 0.5  # Healthy social life
elif social_normalized > 0.5:
    reward += 0.2  # Adequate
elif social_normalized > 0.2:
    reward -= 0.5  # Lonely
else:
    reward -= 2.0  # Isolated (critical)
```

---

## New Affordance: Bar

**File**: `src/hamlet/environment/entities.py`, `affordances.py`

```python
class Bar(Affordance):
    """Bar: Social hub - expensive multi-cost, mandatory for social"""

AFFORDANCE_EFFECTS = {
    "Bar": {
        "money": -15.0,    # Expensive night out
        "energy": -20.0,   # Tiring (late night)
        "hygiene": -15.0,  # Get dirty/sweaty
        "social": 50.0,    # ONLY source! (mandatory)
        "satiation": 30.0, # Eat while there
        "stress": -25.0,   # Social interaction reduces stress
    },
}
```

**Position**: (4, 4) - Near center, social hub
**Icon**: üç∫ (beer mug, pink background)

### Why These Costs?

**Money (-$15)**: Most expensive single transaction
- Makes Bar a significant economic decision
- Can't afford Bar + all services every cycle
- Forces prioritization

**Energy (-20)**: Highest energy cost
- Late night out = exhaustion
- Creates recovery need (must go to Bed afterward)

**Hygiene (-15)**: High hygiene cost
- Crowded bar = get dirty/sweaty
- Creates follow-up need (must Shower)

**Benefits are strong but create cascades**:
- Social (+50): Large boost, but...
- Satiation (+30): Helpful, but...
- Stress (-25): Good, but...
- **After Bar**: Low energy + low hygiene ‚Üí must use Bed + Shower ‚Üí costs more money

---

## Updated Economics: Deficit Forcing

### Old Balance (Recreation):
- Full cycle: Bed + Shower + Fridge + Recreation = $20
- Income: 1 Job = $30
- Net: +$10/cycle (sustainable)

### New Balance (Bar added):
- Full services: Bed + Shower + Fridge + Recreation + Bar = $35
- Income: 1 Job = $30
- **Net: -$5/cycle** (unsustainable!)

### Strategic Implications:

**Can't afford everything every cycle** - Agent must:
1. **Prioritize Bar** (mandatory for social)
2. **Work more often** (2 Jobs per "full cycle")
3. **Skip optional services** (Recreation can be delayed)
4. **Chain efficiently** (Bar ‚Üí Bed ‚Üí Shower sequence)

**Sustainable patterns**:
- Work-Work-Bar-Bed-Shower-Fridge = Break even
- Work-Bar-Bed-Shower-Work-Fridge-Recreation = Slight positive
- Must discover multi-step planning

---

## The "Mandatory Sink" Pattern

### What Makes This Design Brilliant:

**1. Single Source Constraint**
- Social ONLY from Bar
- No substitution possible
- Creates hard dependency

**2. Expensive Source**
- Bar costs most ($15)
- Also costs energy + hygiene
- Can't be spammed

**3. Cascading Effects**
- Bar ‚Üí Need Bed (energy)
- Bar ‚Üí Need Shower (hygiene)
- Those cost money
- Must work more

**4. Strategic Depth**
- When to go to Bar? (before social critical)
- How to afford it? (work first)
- What to skip? (Recreation vs Fridge trade-offs)

**Result**: Standing around is NEVER optimal. Always something critical.

---

## Observed Decision Tree

Agent must learn this decision logic:

```
IF social < 30%:
    IF money < $15:
        ‚Üí Go to Job (need money for Bar)
    ELSE:
        ‚Üí Go to Bar (mandatory social source)
ELSE IF energy < 20%:
    ‚Üí Go to Bed
ELSE IF hygiene < 20%:
    ‚Üí Go to Shower
ELSE IF satiation < 20%:
    ‚Üí Go to Fridge
ELSE IF money < 40%:
    ‚Üí Go to Job (build buffer)
ELSE IF stress > 70%:
    ‚Üí Go to Recreation (if affordable)
```

**Complexity**: 6 meters, 6 affordances, multi-step planning required

---

## State Space Growth

### Meter Count Progression
- **Original**: 4 meters (energy, hygiene, satiation, money)
- **+ Stress**: 5 meters (added work-life balance)
- **+ Social**: 6 meters (added mandatory sink)

### Affordance Count Progression
- **Original**: 4 affordances (Bed, Shower, Fridge, Job)
- **+ Recreation**: 5 affordances (stress management)
- **+ Bar**: 6 affordances (social requirement)

### State Dimensionality
- Grid: 8√ó8 = 64 cells
- Meters: 6 values
- Position: 2 values (x, y)
- **Total**: 72-dimensional state vector

**Observation**: State space grows linearly, but strategic complexity grows combinatorially.

## Frontend Visualization

### Meter Panel
- Social displays as percentage (like bio meters)
- Pink color scheme (#ec4899)
- Critical threshold: <20%

### Grid
- Bar renders at (4, 4)
- Icon: üç∫ (beer mug)
- Pink background (#ec4899)

## Future Complexity Layer: Social‚ÜíStress Amplification

**NOTE**: Not yet implemented, but planned for next iteration

### The Mechanic
```python
# In meter depletion:
social_normalized = agent.meters.get("social").normalize()

if social_normalized < 0.2:
    # Loneliness amplifies stress
    stress_multiplier = 3.0  # 3x faster stress accumulation
else:
    stress_multiplier = 1.0  # Normal stress rate

# Apply to Job stress effect
if action == Job:
    stress_gain = 25.0 * stress_multiplier  # 75 stress if lonely!
```

### Why This Is Brilliant

**Indirect Causality**:
- Social doesn't kill directly
- Low social ‚Üí stress increases faster
- Max stress ‚Üí death
- Agent must discover: Social ‚Üí Stress ‚Üí Death chain

**Hidden Variable Problem**:
- "Social doesn't seem to kill me..."
- "But when it's low, I die faster... why?"
- "Oh! It amplifies stress from work!"
- Emergent understanding of complex systems

**Strategic Implications**:
- Can't just optimize meters independently
- Must understand relationships
- Social becomes even more critical
- Bar visits become more strategic (maintain buffer to prevent stress spiral)

**Pedagogical Value**:
- Teaches indirect effects
- Shows systemic thinking
- Models real-world complexity (isolation ‚Üí burnout ‚Üí breakdown)

## Pedagogical Applications

### Teaching Moment 1: Mandatory Diversity

**Lesson**: Can't optimize subset of system
- Student might try: "Just work and use basic services"
- Reality: Social depletes ‚Üí penalties accumulate ‚Üí death
- Discovery: "Oh, I HAVE to go to Bar"

**Analogy**: Real life - can't ignore social needs even if inconvenient

### Teaching Moment 2: Expensive Necessities

**Lesson**: Some needs are both mandatory AND costly
- Bar is most expensive single action
- But social is mandatory
- Must find money for it

**Analogy**: Real life - healthcare, housing, education (expensive but necessary)

### Teaching Moment 3: Cascading Resource Management

**Lesson**: Actions have follow-on effects
- Bar ‚Üí low energy ‚Üí need Bed ‚Üí costs money
- Chain reactions in resource systems
- Planning must account for sequences

**Analogy**: Real life - social event ‚Üí tired ‚Üí skip work ‚Üí less money

### Teaching Moment 4: Trade-offs Under Scarcity

**Lesson**: Can't afford everything
- Income ($30/job) < Full services ($35)
- Must prioritize
- Different strategies viable

**Analogy**: Real life - budgeting, opportunity costs

## Expected Agent Behaviors

### Predicted Strategy 1: "Social Prioritizer"
```
Work ‚Üí Work ‚Üí Bar ‚Üí Bed ‚Üí Shower ‚Üí Work ‚Üí Fridge ‚Üí (repeat)
```
- Maintains social (mandatory)
- Works often (needs money for Bar)
- Skips Recreation (not mandatory)
- Sustainable but stressful

### Predicted Strategy 2: "Balanced Budget"
```
Work ‚Üí Bar ‚Üí Bed ‚Üí Work ‚Üí Shower ‚Üí Fridge ‚Üí Recreation ‚Üí (repeat)
```
- Manages all 6 meters
- Works 2x per cycle (income = costs)
- Includes Recreation (stress management)
- More complex but sustainable

### Predicted Strategy 3: "Reactive Crisis" (sub-optimal)
```
(random movement until meter critical) ‚Üí (desperate action) ‚Üí (repeat)
```
- No planning
- Frequent deaths
- Agent should learn this fails

**Optimal**: Likely Strategy 2 (balanced 6-meter management)

## Testing Validation

### Test 1: Social Depletion
```bash
uv run python -c "
from src.hamlet.environment.hamlet_env import HamletEnv
env = HamletEnv()
env.reset()
agent = env.agents['agent_0']

print(f'Initial social: {agent.meters.get(\"social\").value}')

# Wait 20 steps (no Bar visit)
for _ in range(20):
    env.step(0)

print(f'After 20 steps: {agent.meters.get(\"social\").value}')
print(f'Expected: ~38 (50 - 20*0.6)')
"
```

### Test 2: Bar Effects
```bash
uv run python -c "
from src.hamlet.environment.hamlet_env import HamletEnv
env = HamletEnv()
env.reset()
agent = env.agents['agent_0']

# Move to Bar and use it
env.reset()
for _ in range(10):
    env.step(1)  # Move to (4,4)

before = {
    'money': agent.meters.get('money').value,
    'energy': agent.meters.get('energy').value,
    'hygiene': agent.meters.get('hygiene').value,
    'social': agent.meters.get('social').value,
}

env.step(4)  # INTERACT at Bar

after = {
    'money': agent.meters.get('money').value,
    'energy': agent.meters.get('energy').value,
    'hygiene': agent.meters.get('hygiene').value,
    'social': agent.meters.get('social').value,
}

print('Bar visit effects:')
print(f'  Money: {before[\"money\"]:.1f} ‚Üí {after[\"money\"]:.1f} ({after[\"money\"]-before[\"money\"]:.1f})')
print(f'  Energy: {before[\"energy\"]:.1f} ‚Üí {after[\"energy\"]:.1f} ({after[\"energy\"]-before[\"energy\"]:.1f})')
print(f'  Hygiene: {before[\"hygiene\"]:.1f} ‚Üí {after[\"hygiene\"]:.1f} ({after[\"hygiene\"]-before[\"hygiene\"]:.1f})')
print(f'  Social: {before[\"social\"]:.1f} ‚Üí {after[\"social\"]:.1f} ({after[\"social\"]-before[\"social\"]:.1f})')
"
```

### Test 3: Economic Deficit
```bash
# Verify can't afford full cycle on 1 Job
# Full services = $35, Job = $30
# Deficit = -$5
```

## Comparison to Real-World AI Systems

### The "Social Media Engagement" Problem

**Real AI systems** (recommendation algorithms):
- Optimize engagement (clicks, time-on-site)
- Ignore well-being (stress, sleep, real social connections)
- Result: Addictive but harmful patterns

**Hamlet Bar mechanic teaches**:
- Must optimize MULTIPLE competing objectives
- Some needs are expensive but mandatory
- Ignoring one dimension causes cascade failures
- No "lazy" equilibrium - must engage fully

**Lesson**: Multi-objective optimization is hard but necessary

## Metrics to Track

### Agent Performance
| Metric | Expected |
|--------|----------|
| Bar Visits/Episode | 3-5 (mandatory social maintenance) |
| Job Visits/Episode | 6-8 (need income for Bar + services) |
| Average Social Level | 40-60% (maintained above critical) |
| Death by Social | <5% (should learn criticality) |
| Death by Stress | 10-15% (complex management) |
| Average Survival | 450+ steps (longer than 5-meter) |

### Complexity Indicators
| Indicator | Measurement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Decision Diversity | Actions per episode (should use all 6 affordances) |
| Planning Depth | Steps between decisions (should plan 3-5 ahead) |
| Resource Utilization | % of money spent (should be high, near deficit) |

---

## Expected Training Challenges

### Challenge 1: Social Discovery
- Early agents may ignore social (no immediate death)
- Social depletes slowly ‚Üí penalties accumulate
- Agent must learn: social critical despite delayed effect

**Solution**: Gradient rewards provide continuous feedback

### Challenge 2: Bar Cost Management
- Bar is expensive ‚Üí hesitation
- But mandatory ‚Üí must learn to afford it
- Requires working more often

**Solution**: Proximity shaping guides to Job when money low

### Challenge 3: Cascade Management
- Bar ‚Üí low energy/hygiene ‚Üí need more services ‚Üí need more money
- Complex chain of dependencies
- Requires multi-step planning

**Solution**: Experience replay helps learn sequences

---

## Conclusion

The Bar/Social system transforms Hamlet from **multi-resource survival** to **forced multi-objective optimization**.

**Key innovations**:
1. ‚úÖ Mandatory sink (social only from Bar)
2. ‚úÖ Expensive source (Bar costs most)
3. ‚úÖ Cascading effects (Bar ‚Üí Bed ‚Üí Shower ‚Üí more work)
4. ‚úÖ Economic deficit (can't afford everything)
5. ‚úÖ No lazy equilibrium (always something critical)

**Result**: Agent must develop sophisticated, multi-step strategies to survive.

**Pedagogical value**: Teaches that real optimization problems have:
- Mandatory but expensive requirements
- Cascading resource dependencies
- No simple equilibria
- Continuous adaptation required

**Next**: Train agent and observe if it discovers sustainable 6-meter balance!

---

**Future enhancement**: Social‚Üístress amplification adds indirect causality layer, teaching hidden variable reasoning and systemic thinking.
