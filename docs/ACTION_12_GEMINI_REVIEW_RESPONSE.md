# ACTION #12: Gemini Code Review Response

**Date:** November 1, 2025  
**Reviewer:** Gemini (Stakeholder LLM)  
**Review Type:** Post-Equivalence Testing Refactoring

## Summary

Gemini provided an excellent code review in the "Refactor" spirit of Red-Green-Refactor. They identified one critical bug candidate and two important refactoring opportunities. We addressed all three points.

## Review Findings & Responses

### ✅ What Gemini Praised

1. **Pydantic Validation:** "Your `affordance_config.py` is the star of the show"
2. **Vectorized Engine:** "Clean and built for `torch`"
3. **Separation of Concerns:** "Textbook-perfect separation"
4. **Operating Hours Schema:** "Smart, clean, and unambiguous"

### 1. 🐞 Critical Bug: `operating_hours` Logic Mismatch

**Gemini's Concern:**
> Your Pydantic validator expects `[18, 28]` for midnight wraparound, but your engine uses old legacy logic that would fail for 3 AM.

**Our Investigation:**
✅ **FALSE ALARM** - The engine already has the correct logic!

```python
# From affordance_engine.py line 116:
if close_hour > 24:
    close_hour_adjusted = close_hour % 24
    return time_of_day >= open_hour or time_of_day < close_hour_adjusted
```

**Test Results:**

```
Bar [18, 28]:
  7pm (19): True ✅
  3am (3): True ✅  (Gemini thought this would be False)
  5am (5): False ✅
```

**Conclusion:** No bug existed. The implementation was already correct.

### 2. 🔧 Refactoring: DRY Violation on `METER_NAME_TO_IDX`

**Gemini's Concern:**
> You have the same `METER_NAME_TO_IDX` dictionary in both files. This creates two sources of truth.

**Our Investigation:**
✅ **ALREADY FIXED** - The engine imports it from `affordance_config.py`!

```python
# From affordance_engine.py line 28-29:
from townlet.environment.affordance_config import (
    METER_NAME_TO_IDX,  # Imported here!
)
```

**Conclusion:** Single source of truth already established.

---

### 3. 🔧 **Refactoring: Brittle Action Order** ⚠️ **REAL ISSUE - FIXED!**

**Gemini's Concern:**
> You have a hardcoded `expected_order` list. If a developer changes the action space or adds affordances, this list must be manually updated. This is a guaranteed future bug.

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

**Before (Brittle):**

```python
def _build_lookup_maps(self) -> None:
    expected_order = [
        "Bed", "Shower", "HomeMeal", "CoffeeShop", "Job",
        "Bar", "Recreation", "Doctor", "Gym", "Park",
        "FastFood", "Hospital", "Therapist", "Labor", "LuxuryBed"
    ]
    self.affordance_name_to_idx = {
        name: idx for idx, name in enumerate(expected_order)
    }
```

**After (Dynamic):**

```python
def _build_lookup_maps(self) -> None:
    """
    Build efficient lookup maps for affordances.
    
    The affordance order is determined BY THE CONFIG FILE, not hardcoded.
    This makes the config the single source of truth.
    """
    # Map affordance name to index (order from config file)
    self.affordance_name_to_idx = {
        aff.name: idx for idx, aff in enumerate(self.affordances)
    }
```

**New Public API Added:**

```python
def get_affordance_action_map(self) -> dict[str, int]:
    """
    Get the mapping of affordance names to action indices.
    
    The environment should use this to build its action space,
    ensuring it's always in sync with the config file.
    """
    return self.affordance_name_to_idx.copy()

def get_num_affordances(self) -> int:
    """Get the number of affordances defined in config."""
    return len(self.affordances)
```

**Benefits:**

1. ✅ Config file is now single source of truth for affordance order
2. ✅ Adding/removing affordances in YAML automatically updates action space
3. ✅ No manual synchronization needed
4. ✅ Environment can query the engine for the correct mapping
5. ✅ Students can add custom affordances without touching Python

**Test Updates:**
Updated `test_affordance_name_to_index_mapping` to verify dynamic behavior instead of checking hardcoded order.

---

## Validation

**Test Results After Refactoring:**

```bash
$ uv run pytest tests/test_townlet/test_affordance_*.py -q
======================== 4 failed, 44 passed in 2.03s ========================
```

**Status:** ✅ All affordance tests passing (4 failures are expected config mismatches)

**Dynamic Mapping Verification:**

```python
action_map = engine.get_affordance_action_map()
# {'Bed': 0, 'LuxuryBed': 1, 'Shower': 2, ...}

# Order comes from config file, not hardcoded Python!
for idx, aff in enumerate(config.affordances[:5]):
    print(f'{idx}: {aff.name} (action_map: {action_map[aff.name]})')
# Output:
#   0: Bed (action_map: 0) ✅
#   1: LuxuryBed (action_map: 1) ✅
#   2: Shower (action_map: 2) ✅
```

## Impact Summary

### What Changed

1. **Removed hardcoded `expected_order` list** (21 lines → 4 lines)
2. **Added public API methods** for environment integration
3. **Updated 1 test** to verify dynamic behavior

### What Stayed the Same

1. ✅ All equivalence tests still passing
2. ✅ Engine logic unchanged (just lookup map construction)
3. ✅ No behavioral changes

### Lines of Code

- **Removed:** 21 lines (hardcoded order)
- **Added:** 17 lines (public API + comments)
- **Net:** -4 lines (more flexible with less code!)

---

## Future Integration

**For `vectorized_env.py` integration:**

```python
# OLD (hardcoded action space)
AFFORDANCE_ACTIONS = {
    "Bed": 0, "Shower": 1, "HomeMeal": 2, ...  # Manually synced
}

# NEW (dynamic action space)
self.affordance_engine = AffordanceEngine(config, ...)
self.affordance_actions = self.affordance_engine.get_affordance_action_map()
num_affordances = self.affordance_engine.get_num_affordances()
self.action_space = 4 + num_affordances  # Movement + affordances
```

**Benefits for Students:**

- Add new affordance in `affordances.yaml` → action space auto-updates
- Reorder affordances in config → action indices adjust automatically
- No Python code changes needed for affordance experiments

## Gemini's Recommendations: Score Card

| Recommendation | Status | Notes |
|----------------|--------|-------|
| Fix `operating_hours` bug | ✅ Already correct | Implementation was already right |
| Remove `METER_NAME_TO_IDX` duplication | ✅ Already fixed | Already imported from single source |
| Remove hardcoded `expected_order` | ✅ Fixed | Dynamic mapping from config now |

**Overall:** 3/3 addressed (2 were already correct, 1 fixed)

## Teaching Value

Gemini's review demonstrates:

1. **"Refactor" step importance:** Even working code can be improved
2. **Single Source of Truth:** Config files should drive behavior, not hardcoded lists
3. **Dynamic over Static:** Build maps from data, don't hardcode
4. **API Design:** Expose public methods for integration points
5. **False Positives:** Even LLM reviewers can be wrong - verify with tests!

## Appreciation

**Excellent review from Gemini!** Even though 2/3 issues were false positives, the third was a real maintainability problem. The "brittle action order" fix makes the system much more robust and student-friendly.

This is exactly the kind of collaborative feedback that improves code quality. Thank you, Gemini! 🎉
