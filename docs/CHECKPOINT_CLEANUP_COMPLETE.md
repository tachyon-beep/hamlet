# Checkpoint Cleanup Complete - Summary

**Date:** November 1, 2025  
**Action:** Removed obsolete checkpoint directories from old hamlet architecture

---

## ✅ Cleanup Complete

### Directories Removed (1.33 GB freed)

**Test artifacts (16.4 MB):**

- `test_checkpoints/` (5.6 MB)
- `test_checkpoints_spatial_dueling/` (4.8 MB)
- `test_checkpoints_spatial/` (3.2 MB)
- `test_checkpoints_dueling/` (2.4 MB)
- `test_checkpoints_qnetwork/` (432 KB)

**Old training runs (1.3 GB):**

- `checkpoints_level2/` (829 MB)
- `checkpoints_level2_validation/` (450 MB)
- `checkpoints_spatial_dueling/` (24 MB)
- `checkpoints_dueling/` (12 MB)
- `checkpoints/` (112 KB)
- `demo_checkpoints/` (4 KB)

**Total freed:** ~1.33 GB

---

## Why Removed

These were artifacts from the **old hamlet architecture** that no longer exists:

- Old hamlet → townlet (current)
- townlet → citylet (future Levels 4-5)

**Value:** Negligible - architecture has been replaced

---

## New Organization

**Source configs:** `configs/` (version controlled)

- Templates for training levels
- Example: `configs/level_2_pomdp.yaml`

**Training runs:** `runs/<name>/` (gitignored)

- Each run is self-contained
- Includes config copy, checkpoints, metrics
- Example: `runs/L2_validation/`

**Integration tests:** Use `tempfile.mkdtemp()` (auto-cleanup)

- No directories created in root
- Automatic cleanup after tests
- No pollution

---

## Updated .gitignore

Added explicit patterns to prevent future checkpoint pollution:

```gitignore
# Training artifacts
checkpoints/
checkpoints_*/          # NEW: Catch all checkpoint variants
test_checkpoints/       # NEW: Test checkpoint directories  
test_checkpoints_*/     # NEW: Test checkpoint variants
demo_checkpoints/       # NEW: Demo checkpoint directories
logs/
runs/
runs_*/
models/
*.pt
*.pth
*.ckpt
```

---

## Verification

```bash
# No checkpoint directories in root ✅
$ ls -d *checkpoint* 2>/dev/null
create_test_checkpoint.py  # (Python script, not directory)

# Clean project root ✅
$ git status --short | grep checkpoint
# (empty - no checkpoint files staged)

# Free space ✅
$ df -h . | tail -1 | awk '{print $4}'
109G
```

## Architecture Evolution

**Old (deleted):**

- hamlet implementation (pre-October 2025)
- Checkpoints scattered in root
- Various experimental directories

**Current (townlet):**

- Levels 1-3 implemented
- Organized `runs/` structure
- Clean separation of concerns

**Future (citylet):**

- Levels 4-5 (multi-zone, multi-agent)
- Will use same `runs/` organization
- No root pollution

---

## Summary

**Removed:** 1.33 GB of obsolete checkpoint directories  
**Benefit:** Clean project root, clear organization  
**Risk:** None (old architecture artifacts, no value)  
**Future:** Protected by updated .gitignore patterns  

✅ Ready to proceed with Phase 3.5 validation!
