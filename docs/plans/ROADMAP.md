# Townlet Development Roadmap

> **Last Updated:** 2025-10-30

> **Current Status:** Phase 3 Complete âœ…

## Strategic Direction: 2 â†’ 3 â†’ 1

After completing Phase 3 (Intrinsic Exploration), we've adopted a strategic sequence to avoid premature optimization:

1. **Multi-Day Demo** (Phase 3.5) - Validate system works in production
2. **POMDP Extension** (Phase 4) - Add complexity (partial observability + LSTM)
3. **Optimization** (Phase 5) - Profile and optimize the complete system

**Rationale:** Avoid the 1â†’3â†’1 trap where we optimize for a system that doesn't exist yet. Instead, add POMDP first, then optimize based on real profiling data from the complete system.

## Phase 3: Intrinsic Exploration âœ… COMPLETE

**Status:** All 8 tasks complete, 37/37 tests passing, pushed to origin/main

**Delivered:**

- ReplayBuffer with dual reward storage (extrinsic + intrinsic)
- RND (Random Network Distillation) for novelty detection
- AdaptiveIntrinsicExploration with variance-based annealing
- VectorizedPopulation integration with Q-learning + RND training
- 4 Vue visualization components (novelty heatmap, reward charts, curriculum tracker, survival trends)
- End-to-end sparse learning tests
- Comprehensive documentation

**Key Achievement:** Agents can now learn in sparse reward environments using intrinsic motivation that automatically transitions to exploitation.

**Test Results:**

- Unit tests: 13/13 passing
- Integration tests: 1/1 passing
- End-to-end: 1/1 passing (baseline comparison shows adaptive intrinsic > epsilon-greedy)

**Known Limitations (documented, not blocking):**

- No target network (simplified DQN)
- RND buffer uses CPU transfers (performance trade-off)
- Hardcoded batch size and training frequency

---

## Phase 3.5: Multi-Day Tech Demo ðŸŽ¯ NEXT

**Goal:** Validate Phase 3 system works in production over extended runtime (days) and generate teaching materials.

**Why This First:**

- Validates the "watchers get more invested over time" hypothesis
- Reveals any stability issues (memory leaks, NaN losses, crashes) before adding POMDP complexity
- Generates real data on explorationâ†’exploitation transition for teaching
- Uses existing code - low risk, high value

**Approach:**

- Run 10K episode training (full `test_sparse_learning_with_intrinsic` test)
- Stream live visualization via WebSocket (port 8765)
- Monitor metrics over hours/days: survival trends, intrinsic weight decay, curriculum progression
- Capture screenshots and data for teaching materials

**Success Criteria:**

- [ ] Training runs for 48+ hours without crashes
- [ ] Intrinsic weight anneals from 1.0 â†’ <0.1
- [ ] Agent progresses through all 5 curriculum stages
- [ ] Final survival time > 200 steps (vs ~115 baseline)
- [ ] Visualization components update in real-time
- [ ] No memory leaks or performance degradation

**Deliverables:**

- Training logs and metrics (JSON or CSV)
- Screenshots showing explorationâ†’exploitation transition
- Performance report (survival over time, reward components, curriculum progression)
- Optional: Teaching guide using the demo data

**Estimated Duration:** 2-3 days runtime + 1 day setup/monitoring

## Phase 4: POMDP Extension (Level 2) ðŸ“‹ PLANNED

**Goal:** Add partial observability and working memory to create more realistic, pedagogically valuable scenarios.

**Why After Multi-Day Demo:**

- Multi-day demo validates Phase 3 foundation is solid
- POMDP will stress the system - better to know current system works first
- Adding complexity before optimization lets us optimize based on real needs

**Core Changes:**

- **Partial Observability:** Agents see limited field of view (e.g., 3Ã—3 window around position)
- **LSTM Memory:** Temporal state integration for sequential reasoning
- **Modified Observation:** Add "fog of war" - unknown cells have null/masked values
- **New Reward Shaping:** Encourage exploration to discover hidden affordances

**Architecture:**

- Modify `VectorizedHamletEnv` to provide partial observations
- Update Q-networks to include LSTM layer
- Extend `BatchedAgentState` with hidden state management
- Modify RND to work with partial observations (or full state for novelty)

**Teaching Value:**

- Demonstrates working memory requirements
- Shows how partial observability affects exploration
- Creates "interesting failures" when agents forget affordance locations
- Introduces recurrent architectures

**Deliverables:**

- Partial observability implementation
- LSTM-based Q-networks
- Tests validating hidden state propagation
- Documentation of POMDP-specific behaviors

**Estimated Duration:** 5-7 days implementation

**Note:** Don't optimize during this phase. Accept "good enough" performance. Focus on getting POMDP working correctly. Document what's slow or unstable for Phase 5.

---

## Phase 5: Informed Optimization ðŸ“‹ PLANNED

**Goal:** Profile the complete system (Phase 3 + POMDP) and optimize based on real bottlenecks.

**Why Last:**

- Avoids premature optimization (the 1â†’3â†’1 trap)
- Optimization targets are informed by POMDP requirements
- We know which issues actually matter vs. theoretical concerns
- One clean optimization pass instead of multiple revisions

**Optimization Candidates (from Phase 3 code reviews):**

- **Target Network:** Add to DQN for training stability (especially important with LSTM?)
- **Double DQN:** Reduce overestimation bias
- **Dueling Architecture:** Separate value/advantage streams
- **GPU Optimization:** Fix RND CPU transfers, batch LSTM operations
- **Gradient Clipping:** Tune for LSTM gradient flow
- **Buffer Management:** Optimize replay buffer for LSTM sequences
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Learning rates, batch sizes, update frequencies

**Process:**

1. **Profile:** Use cProfile, PyTorch profiler, memory profiler on POMDP system
2. **Identify Bottlenecks:** Find actual slow points (not guesses)
3. **Prioritize:** Fix issues by impact (biggest speedup first)
4. **Validate:** Ensure optimizations don't break POMDP correctness
5. **Document:** Record performance improvements

**Success Criteria:**

- [ ] Training speed: 2-5x faster (target: 100 episodes/hour â†’ 200-500 episodes/hour)
- [ ] Memory stable over 10K episodes (no leaks)
- [ ] No NaN losses during LSTM training
- [ ] All tests still pass after optimization
- [ ] Profiling report showing improvements

**Deliverables:**

- Optimized codebase
- Performance benchmarks (before/after)
- Profiling reports
- Documentation of optimization strategies

**Estimated Duration:** 3-5 days

---

## Phase 6: Multi-Agent Competition (Level 4) ðŸ“‹ FUTURE

**Goal:** Add competitive multi-agent scenarios with theory of mind.

**Concepts:**

- Agents compete for limited resources (only one can use Job at a time)
- Theory of mind: predict other agents' actions
- Emergent cooperation or competition
- Communication (implicit via observation)

**Teaching Value:**

- Game theory applications
- Social intelligence
- Emergent behavior
- Multi-agent RL challenges

**Status:** Exploratory - depends on Phase 4/5 success

---

## Phase 7: Emergent Communication (Level 5) ðŸ“‹ FUTURE

**Goal:** Family units with emergent language and communication.

**Concepts:**

- Family members can share information
- Communication channel (discrete symbols)
- Emergent protocols for coordination
- Language grounding in shared experience

**Teaching Value:**

- Language emergence
- Communication protocols
- Coordination problems
- Symbolic reasoning

**Status:** Aspirational - long-term vision

## North Star Vision: Social Hamlet ðŸŒŸ ENDSTATE

**The Big Picture:** Where Hamlet could go with infinite time and infinite coders.

### Scale & Complexity

**Environment:**

- **50Ã—50 grid** (vs current 8Ã—8) - room to roam and form territories
- **Dozens of agents** simultaneously (vs current single agent)
- **Continuous affordance usage** - agents "toggle on" affordances, blocking others
- **Multiple instances** of each affordance type (e.g., 3 jobs with different pay rates)
- **Dynamic environment** - affordances can move, appear, disappear over time
- **Day/Night cycle** - affects affordance availability and agent behavior
- **Seasons/Events** - periodic changes affecting resources and social dynamics
- **Persistent world state** - environment retains changes over time
- **Agent memory** - agents remember past interactions and routines
- **Advanced sensory input** - agents perceive more complex state (e.g., other agents' positions, affordance states)
- **Complex affordance interactions** - some affordances require prerequisites or have cooldowns
- **Extended time horizon** - agents plan over days/weeks, not just episodes
- **Goal diversity** - agents have varied objectives (wealth, social status, survival)
- **Economic system** - agents trade resources, services, and favors
- **Social structures** - agents form friendships, rivalries, families
- **Governance mechanisms** - rules or norms emerge to regulate behavior
- **Political dynamics** - power structures and alliances form among agents
- **Long-term consequences** - actions have lasting effects on reputation and resources

### Emergent Social Dynamics

**Strategic Competition:**

- **Agent A notices Agent B's routine:** "B goes to the high-paying job at 9 AM every morning"
- **Agent A adapts strategically:** Arrives at 8 AM to take the job first
- **Agent B must find alternative:** Learns new routine or competes for timing

**Social Penalties:**

- **Proximity cost:** Agents take negative reward when near each other
- **Resource blocking:** "You're using something I want" creates tension
- **Reputation/memory:** Agents remember who blocks them frequently
- **Emergent territoriality:** Agents may stake out regions to avoid others

**Economic Hierarchy:**

- **Tiered housing:** Better houses give better rewards but cost more
- **Job competition:** High-paying jobs are scarce, low-paying are plentiful
- **Affordability trade-offs:** Save money for expensive house vs. use cheap options

**Families:**

- **Family Units:** Agents can form families sharing resources and responsibilities.
- **Shared Goals:** Families coordinate schedules to avoid conflicts
- **Communication:** Emergent signaling of intentions, families will have a communications channel but this will not be defined. Agents can evolve their own protocols.

### Teaching Value (The Real Goal)

**Novel Pedagogical Opportunities:**

1. **Game Theory in Action:** Students see Nash equilibria emerge naturally
2. **Social Intelligence:** Agents learn theory of mind (predicting others' actions)
3. **Temporal Strategy:** Planning ahead ("I'll go early tomorrow") vs reactive behavior
4. **Emergent Social Norms:** Do cooperation patterns emerge despite individual incentives?
5. **Resource Allocation:** Market dynamics without explicit prices
6. **Conflict Resolution:** How do agents handle competition? Avoidance? Aggression?

**Specific Scenarios:**

- "Watch Agent A steal Agent B's job every morning"
- "See agents form 'day shift' and 'night shift' patterns to avoid each other"
- "Agent C discovers the cheap house + cheap job is actually more profitable (less competition)"
- "Agent D aggressively blocks others from premium resources, pays social cost"

### Technical Prerequisites

**What needs to exist first:**

- âœ… Phase 3: Intrinsic motivation and curriculum (done)
- âœ… Phase 3.5: Multi-day stability validation (next)
- â¬œ Phase 4: POMDP + memory (agents need memory to predict others' routines)
- â¬œ Phase 5: Optimization (50x50 grid requires GPU efficiency)
- â¬œ Phase 6: Multi-agent coordination primitives
- â¬œ Phase 7: Communication (agents signal intentions or negotiate)
- â¬œ **New Phase:** Continuous affordance usage + blocking mechanics
- â¬œ **New Phase:** Social penalty rewards + proximity sensing
- â¬œ **New Phase:** Theory of mind networks (predict other agents)

### Why Document This Now?

**Good bones first:** Every phase builds toward this vision:

- SQLite schema â†’ extends to `agent_interactions`, `resource_ownership`, `social_graph`
- Position heatmaps â†’ per-agent heatmaps
- Affordance transitions â†’ "who arrived first" temporal data
- Intrinsic motivation â†’ "social novelty" (encountering new agents)
- Curriculum â†’ add "social complexity" stage

**Avoiding overengineering:** Knowing the endstate helps us avoid premature abstraction while keeping doors open (the "for but not with" principle).

**Timeline:** 2-3 years of part-time work, or 6-12 months with dedicated team. Not immediate, but worth building toward.

## Decision Log

### 2025-10-30: Adopted 2â†’3â†’1 Strategy

**Decision:** Do multi-day demo â†’ POMDP â†’ optimization (not demo â†’ optimization â†’ POMDP)

**Rationale:**

- Avoids 1â†’3â†’1 trap (optimizing twice)
- POMDP reveals real optimization needs
- Current system is proven stable (37/37 tests)
- Optimization targets are concrete not theoretical

**Trade-offs Considered:**

- **Pro (1 first):** Fix known issues while fresh, cleaner foundation
- **Pro (3 first):** One optimization pass, informed by real needs, no wasted work
- **Conclusion:** Real profiling data > theoretical concerns

### 2025-10-28: Completed Phase 2 (Adversarial Curriculum)

**Achievement:** 5-stage curriculum with entropy-gated progression, 13/13 tests passing

### 2025-10-27: Completed Phase 1 (Vectorized Environment)

**Achievement:** GPU-native 8Ã—8 grid environment with 4 affordances, 4 meters
