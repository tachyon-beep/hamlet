class RewardStrategy:
    """
    Calculates rewards based on survival milestones.

    Problem with constant per-step rewards: Rewards aimless wandering equally to strategic play.
    Solution: Milestone bonuses that reward longevity without constant accumulation.

    Reward Structure:
    - Every 10 steps: +0.5 ("you're making progress!")
    - Every 100 steps: +5.0 ("happy birthday!" ðŸŽ‚)
    - Death: -100.0

    This prevents left-right oscillation from being rewarded while still encouraging survival.

    Note: Step 0 triggers both milestones (0 % 10 == 0 AND 0 % 100 == 0) for 5.5 reward.
