## What Was Extracted

### From vectorized_env.py (lines 869-902)
```python
def _calculate_shaped_rewards(self) -> torch.Tensor:
    """MILESTONE SURVIVAL REWARDS: 34-line method with reward logic"""
    # Decade milestone: +0.5 every 10 steps
    # Century milestone: +5.0 every 100 steps
    # Death penalty: -100.0
```

### To reward_strategy.py (68 lines)
```python
class RewardStrategy:
    """Encapsulated reward calculation with milestone logic"""
    def __init__(self, device: torch.device)
    def calculate_rewards(self, step_counts, dones) -> torch.Tensor
```

### New Integration in vectorized_env.py
```python
# Constructor (line 104):
self.reward_strategy = RewardStrategy(device=device)

# _calculate_shaped_rewards (lines 883-886):
return self.reward_strategy.calculate_rewards(
    step_counts=self.step_counts,
    dones=self.dones,
)
```

## Red-Green Process

### üî¥ RED Phase: Characterization Tests (15 min)
**Goal:** Document actual behavior before extraction

**Created:** `test_reward_strategy.py` with 6 tests
1. test_milestone_every_10_steps
2. test_milestone_every_100_steps
3. test_death_penalty
4. test_dead_agents_no_milestone_bonus
5. test_zero_steps_both_milestones ‚≠ê
6. test_combined_milestones

**Discovery:** Step 0 triggers BOTH milestones (0 % 10 == 0 AND 0 % 100 == 0) = 5.5 reward!
- Initial test expected 0.5, got 5.5
- Updated test to document actual behavior
- Edge case caught BEFORE refactoring (Red-Green win!)

**Result:** 6/6 tests passing (GREEN baseline established)

### ‚ôªÔ∏è REFACTOR Phase: Extract Class (10 min)
**Goal:** Move logic to dedicated class

**Steps:**
1. Created `src/townlet/environment/reward_strategy.py` (68 lines)
2. Added import to `vectorized_env.py`
3. Initialized `self.reward_strategy` in constructor
4. Replaced `_calculate_shaped_rewards` body with delegation
5. Added 6 direct tests for new RewardStrategy class

**Result:** 12/12 reward tests passing

### üü¢ GREEN Phase: Validate Zero Regressions (20 min)
**Goal:** Verify all tests still pass

**Steps:**
1. Ran full test suite: 285/285 tests passing ‚úÖ
2. Checked coverage: reward_strategy.py 100%, vectorized_env.py 94%
3. Verified line count reduction: 937 ‚Üí 918 lines

**Result:** Zero behavioral changes, zero test regressions

## Key Insights

### 1. Red-Green Saved Time
- Step 0 edge case discovered in RED phase (before refactoring)
- Would have caused confusion if found during/after extraction
- Characterization tests provide safety net and documentation

### 2. Composition Over Inheritance
- RewardStrategy uses simple composition (delegation pattern)
- Environment owns strategy instance, delegates calculation
- Easy to test in isolation (6 direct tests added)

### 3. Documentation Value
- RewardStrategy class includes "step 0 edge case" in docstring
- Tests serve as executable documentation
- Future developers understand milestone logic immediately

### 4. Minimal Interface
- RewardStrategy exposes single method: `calculate_rewards()`
- Takes tensors, returns tensors (pure function style)
- No environment coupling beyond device

---

## Testing Strategy

### Two Test Surfaces
1. **Legacy Interface:** Test via `env._calculate_shaped_rewards()` (6 tests)
   - Ensures existing code still works
   - Validates integration with environment
   
2. **Direct Interface:** Test `RewardStrategy.calculate_rewards()` (6 tests)
   - Unit tests for extracted class
   - Tests edge cases in isolation
   - Faster execution (no environment setup)

### Edge Cases Validated
- Step 0 behavior (both milestones trigger)
- Step 100 behavior (decade + century = 5.5)
- Dead agents (no milestone bonuses, only -100.0)
- Mixed alive/dead agents
- Non-milestone steps (zero reward)

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. **Red-Green methodology:** Edge case caught early
2. **Test-first extraction:** Zero surprises, zero debugging
3. **Composition pattern:** Clean delegation, easy testing
4. **Documentation:** Tests explain behavior better than comments

### What Could Improve
1. **Line count reduction:** Only -19 lines (expected ~34)
   - Reason: Added initialization + import + delegation wrapper
   - Net reduction smaller due to integration code
   - Still valuable: responsibility separation matters more than LOC

2. **Coverage slight drop:** 96% ‚Üí 94% on vectorized_env
   - Reason: New delegation wrapper has uncovered error paths
   - Not a concern: error paths are defensive (should never trigger)

### Future Improvements
- Consider making RewardStrategy pluggable (strategy pattern)
- Could support multiple reward schemes (milestone vs continuous)
- Useful for curriculum learning experiments

## Next Steps

### Immediate
- ‚úÖ Document completion (this file)
- üéØ Choose next action: ACTION #3 (MeterDynamics) or ACTION #1 (CascadeEngine)?

### Recommendation: ACTION #3 Next
**Rationale:**
- Larger extraction (~150 lines) = more progress toward Phase 2 goal
- MeterDynamics is prerequisite for ACTION #1 (CascadeEngine)
- Follows dependency order (extract before configuring)
- Similar complexity to ACTION #2 (should be 1-2 days with Red-Green)

### Phase 2 Roadmap
- ‚úÖ ACTION #4: ObservationBuilder (-104 lines)
- ‚úÖ ACTION #2: RewardStrategy (-19 lines)
- üéØ ACTION #3: MeterDynamics (-150 lines estimated)
- üéØ ACTION #1: CascadeEngine (refactor MeterDynamics to use data)

**Target:** 1039 ‚Üí ~600 lines (42% reduction)  
**Progress:** 12% complete (121/439 lines extracted)
