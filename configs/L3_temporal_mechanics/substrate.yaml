# Substrate Configuration for Level 3: Temporal Mechanics
#
# Same 8×8 grid as L2, with added temporal mechanics (operating hours,
# multi-tick interactions). Spatial substrate unchanged - temporal features
# controlled in training.yaml via enable_temporal_mechanics=true.
#
# Level 3 characteristics:
# - Same grid as L2 (8×8, 64 cells)
# - 24-tick day/night cycle
# - Operating hours (Job 9am-5pm, Bar 6pm-2am)
# - Multi-tick interactions (75% linear + 25% completion bonus)
# - Time-based action masking
