# cascades.yaml - Threshold-Based Cascade Effects
# This defines how meters affect each other when they fall below thresholds.
#
# Math Approach: GRADIENT PENALTIES (validated with 275 passing tests)
# When source < threshold:
#   deficit = (threshold - source_value) / threshold  # Normalized 0.0-1.0
#   penalty = strength * deficit
#   target -= penalty
#
# This gives smooth gradient gameplay (unlike multipliers which are binary).
# Lower source value → higher deficit → stronger penalty (proportional)
#
# Example: satiation at 20% with 30% threshold
#   deficit = (0.3 - 0.2) / 0.3 = 0.333
#   health_penalty = 0.004 * 0.333 = 0.00133 per step
