# Substrate Configuration for Level 0: Minimal
#
# Defines the spatial substrate (coordinate system, topology, boundaries)
# for the training environment.
#
# Level 0 uses a tiny 3×3 grid for fast pedagogical learning:
# - Minimal exploration space (9 cells)
# - Agent learns temporal credit assignment (spacing > spamming)
# - Simple enough to converge in ~100 episodes
#
# UNIVERSE_AS_CODE: All spatial parameters explicit (no hidden defaults).

description: "3×3 square grid with hard boundaries for Level 0 pedagogical training"

type: "grid"

grid:
  # Square 2D grid topology (standard Cartesian coordinate system)
  # Alternative topologies: (none implemented yet, reserved for future)
  topology: "square"

  # Grid dimensions: 3×3 (9 total cells)
  # Provides minimal space for single affordance (Bed) with navigation
  width: 3
  height: 3

  # Boundary behavior: "clamp" (hard walls, agents cannot move outside grid)
  # When agent tries to move outside: position clamped to grid edges
  #
  # Alternatives (not used in L0):
  #   - "wrap": Toroidal wraparound (Pac-Man style)
  #   - "bounce": Elastic reflection (agent reflects back from boundary)
  #   - "sticky": Sticky walls (agent stays in place when hitting boundary)
  boundary: "clamp"

  # Distance metric: "manhattan" (L1 norm, |x1-x2| + |y1-y2|)
  # Used for proximity calculations and spatial reasoning
  #
  # Manhattan distance characteristics:
  #   - Only cardinal movement (no diagonal shortcuts)
  #   - Distance [0,0] to [2,2] = 4 steps (not 2.83)
  #   - Matches grid movement mechanics
  #
  # Alternatives (not used in L0):
  #   - "euclidean": L2 norm, sqrt((x1-x2)² + (y1-y2)²)
  #   - "chebyshev": L∞ norm, max(|x1-x2|, |y1-y2|)
  distance_metric: "manhattan"
  observation_encoding: "relative"  # NEW Phase 5C: normalized coordinates
