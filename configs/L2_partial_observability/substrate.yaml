# Substrate Configuration for Level 2: Partial Observability (POMDP)
#
# Same 8×8 grid as L1, but agent sees only 5×5 local window. Agent must
# build mental map through exploration (LSTM memory).
#
# Spatial substrate identical to L1 - only observability differs
# (controlled in training.yaml via partial_observability=true).
#
# Level 2 characteristics:
# - Same grid as L1 (8×8, 64 cells)
# - Local vision window (5×5, vision_range=2)
# - Recurrent Q-network with LSTM (~600K params)
# - Agent must build spatial memory
