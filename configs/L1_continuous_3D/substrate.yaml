description: "Continuous 3D volume substrate - full 3D continuous navigation"

type: "continuous"

continuous:
  dimensions: 3

  # Bounds for each dimension
  bounds:
    - [0.0, 10.0]  # X dimension: 0 to 10 units
    - [0.0, 10.0]  # Y dimension: 0 to 10 units
    - [0.0, 10.0]  # Z dimension: 0 to 10 units

  # Boundary handling
  boundary: "clamp"

  # Movement granularity (how far discrete actions move agent)
  movement_delta: 0.5

  # Interaction radius (distance threshold for affordance interaction)
  interaction_radius: 0.8

  # Distance metric
  distance_metric: "euclidean"

  # Observation encoding
  observation_encoding: "relative"  # Normalized coordinates [0,1]

# Use cases:
# - 3D continuous navigation
# - Drone/robot simulation
# - Complex spatial reasoning
# - Advanced continuous control
