# Example: Gym affordance with skill_scaling capability
# 
# This demonstrates how Gym effectiveness improves as fitness increases
# Beginners (fitness=0.0): 1.0x effect multiplier
# Experts (fitness=1.0): 2.0x effect multiplier

        - { meter: energy, amount: -0.15 }  # Workout energy cost
      
      on_completion:
        - { meter: fitness, amount: 0.05 }  # 0.05 → 0.1 as skill improves
        - { meter: health, amount: 0.02 }   # 0.02 → 0.04 as skill improves

teaching_note: |
  Skill scaling creates realistic learning curves:
  - Beginner (fitness=0.1): +0.05 fitness gain (slow progress)
  - Intermediate (fitness=0.5): +0.075 fitness gain (moderate)
  - Expert (fitness=0.9): +0.095 fitness gain (near maximum)
  
  This models real-world skill development where experts see
  diminishing returns but still outperform beginners.
