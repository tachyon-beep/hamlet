description: "Continuous 2D plane substrate - smooth navigation"

type: "continuous"

continuous:
  dimensions: 2

  # Bounds for each dimension
  bounds:
    - [0.0, 10.0]  # X dimension: 0 to 10 units
    - [0.0, 10.0]  # Y dimension: 0 to 10 units

  # Boundary handling
  boundary: "clamp"

  # Movement granularity (how far discrete actions move agent)
  # Smaller = finer control, Larger = faster movement
  movement_delta: 0.5

  # Interaction radius (distance threshold for affordance interaction)
  # Agent must be within this radius to interact
  # Recommendation: interaction_radius >= movement_delta
  interaction_radius: 0.8

  # Distance metric
  distance_metric: "euclidean"

  # Action discretization (Option A: Discretized Continuous Actions)
  # Enables fine-grained directional movement with variable speed
  # If not specified, uses legacy 4-way directional actions
  action_discretization:
    num_directions: 32  # 11.25° angular resolution (360° / 32)
    num_magnitudes: 7   # 7 speed levels: 0%, 16.7%, 33.3%, 50%, 66.7%, 83.3%, 100%
  # Total actions: 1 STOP + (32 dirs × 6 non-zero mags) + INTERACT + WAIT = 195 actions

# Use cases:
# - Robotics simulation (smooth movement)
# - Continuous control problems
# - Teaching discrete vs continuous control
# - Smooth navigation challenges
