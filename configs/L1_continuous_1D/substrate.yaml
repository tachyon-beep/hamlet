description: "Continuous 1D line substrate - pedagogical for teaching continuous control"

type: "continuous"

continuous:
  dimensions: 1

  # Bounds for X dimension
  bounds:
    - [0.0, 10.0]  # X dimension: 0 to 10 units

  # Boundary handling
  boundary: "clamp"

  # Movement granularity (how far discrete actions move agent)
  movement_delta: 0.5

  # Interaction radius (distance threshold for affordance interaction)
  interaction_radius: 0.8

  # Distance metric
  distance_metric: "euclidean"

# Pedagogical value:
# - Simplest continuous space (1D line)
# - Teaches discrete actions in continuous space
# - Shows proximity-based interaction (not exact position match)
# - Movement delta demonstrates action granularity
