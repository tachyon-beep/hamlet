# L1 Continuous 1D: Pedagogical continuous control
#
# Key features:
# - 1D continuous line (0.0 to 10.0 units)
# - Discrete actions with continuous movement (movement_delta=0.5)
# - Proximity-based interaction (interaction_radius=0.8)
# - Standard MLP Q-Network
# - Pedagogical: Simplest continuous space
