# Default Brain Configuration
#
# TEMPORARY: This is a placeholder brain.yaml for configs that don't have one yet.
# TODO: Calibrate these hyperparameters for the specific config pack.
#
# Network: Standard feedforward MLP (256→128 hidden layers)
# Optimizer: Adam with Atari DQN standard learning rate
# Loss: MSE (baseline)
# Q-learning: Double DQN
# Schedule: Constant learning rate
#
# This configuration is NOT optimized - it's just to satisfy the requirement
# that all config packs must have brain.yaml (no backwards compatibility).
