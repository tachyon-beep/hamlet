# ========================================
# DIMENSION VALIDATION
# ========================================
# Total observation dimensions: 0 + 4 + 5 + 4 = 13
# - Position: 0 dims (aspatial - no position)
# - Meters: 4 dims (energy, health, money, mood)
# - Affordance: 5 dims (4 affordances: Bed, Hospital, HomeMeal, Job + "none")
# - Temporal: 4 dims (time_sin, time_cos, interaction_progress, lifetime_progress)
# NOTE: Aspatial substrates have no position or grid_encoding
# NOTE: Test config uses local vocabulary (4 affordances), not global (14)
