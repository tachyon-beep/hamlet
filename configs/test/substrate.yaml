# Substrate Configuration for Integration Testing
#
# Lite version of L1 for automated testing. Same spatial substrate as L1
# (8×8 grid with clamp boundaries) but shorter training runs (200 episodes).
#
# Used for:
# - CI/CD automated testing
# - Quick validation of code changes
# - Behavioral regression detection

version: "1.0"
