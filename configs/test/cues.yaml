# cues.yaml - Public Cue Definitions (Observable Signals)
# This defines how internal meter states map to observable "tells" (public cues).
#
# PURPOSE: Enable Module C (Social Model) to learn opponent modeling
# STATUS: TEMPLATE (Will be implemented after Level 4 multi-agent)
#
# Architecture:
# - Agents have HIDDEN meter states (bars) that opponents can't see directly
# - When certain conditions are met, agents emit PUBLIC CUES (observable tells)
# - Module C learns to infer hidden states from these cues (theory of mind)
#
# Teaching Value:
# - Demonstrates information asymmetry in multi-agent systems
# - Shows how AI can do "theory of mind" reasoning
# - Enables strategic deception and cooperation behaviors
