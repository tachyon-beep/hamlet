# Substrate Configuration for Level 0.5: Dual Resource Management
#
# Slightly larger grid to accommodate 4 affordances (Bed, Hospital, HomeMeal, Job)
# with room for navigation and resource management learning.
#
# Level 0.5 teaches balancing multiple resources:
# - Energy + Health cycles (Bed restores energy, Hospital restores health)
# - Economic loop (Job earns money, money enables affordances)
# - Spatial planning (navigate between 4 affordances)
