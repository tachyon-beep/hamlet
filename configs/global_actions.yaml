description: "Global action vocabulary for HAMLET curriculum"

# Custom actions shared across all curriculum levels
# These must be substrate-agnostic (work on all position_dim values)
#
# Action space for all configs:
#   - Grid2D substrates: 6 substrate + 2 custom = 8 total
#   - Grid3D substrates: 8 substrate + 2 custom = 10 total
#   - Continuous1D: 4 substrate + 2 custom = 6 total
#   - Aspatial: 2 substrate + 2 custom = 4 total
#   - etc.
#
# Per-config enabled_actions list in training.yaml controls which are available

custom_actions:
  # Passive recovery (weak version of Bed affordance)
  - name: "REST"
    type: "passive"
    costs:
      energy: -0.002  # Restores 0.2% energy per step
      mood: -0.01     # Restores 1% mood per step
    description: "Rest in place (weaker than Bed, but available anywhere)"
    icon: "😴"

  # Mental health action
  - name: "MEDITATE"
    type: "passive"
    costs:
      energy: 0.001   # Costs 0.1% energy
    effects:
      mood: 0.02      # Restores 2% mood
    description: "Meditate to improve mood without sleeping"
    icon: "🧘"

# Notes:
# - REST enables gradual recovery without finding Bed
# - MEDITATE provides mood boost without social interaction
# - Both actions work on ALL substrate types (Grid2D/3D/ND, Continuous, Aspatial)
#
# Substrate-specific actions (TELEPORT_HOME, SPRINT) removed from global vocabulary
# because they break on non-2D substrates. Operators should define these in
# config-specific action files if needed.
