# Custom actions shared across all curriculum levels
# Disabled actions still occupy action IDs (for checkpoint transfer)
#
# Action space for all configs:
#   - Grid2D substrates: 6 substrate + 4 custom = 10 total
#   - Grid3D substrates: 8 substrate + 4 custom = 12 total
#   - etc.
#
# Per-config enabled_actions list in training.yaml controls which are available

custom_actions:
  # Passive recovery (weak version of Bed affordance)
  - name: "REST"
    type: "passive"
    costs:
      energy: -0.002  # Restores 0.2% energy per step
      mood: -0.01     # Restores 1% mood per step
    description: "Rest in place (weaker than Bed, but available anywhere)"
    icon: "😴"

  # Mental health action
  - name: "MEDITATE"
    type: "passive"
    costs:
      energy: 0.001   # Costs 0.1% energy
    effects:
      mood: 0.02      # Restores 2% mood
    description: "Meditate to improve mood without sleeping"
    icon: "🧘"

  # Movement shortcut (expensive teleport)
  - name: "TELEPORT_HOME"
    type: "movement"
    teleport_to: [0, 0]  # Warp to origin
    costs:
      energy: 0.5      # 50% energy cost
      money: 10.0      # $10 teleport fee
    description: "Instantly return to home position (expensive)"
    icon: "🏠"

  # Fast movement (high cost)
  - name: "SPRINT"
    type: "movement"
    delta: [0, -2]  # Move 2 cells north (assumes Grid2D)
    costs:
      energy: 0.02     # 2% energy (4x normal movement)
      satiation: 0.01  # 1% satiation (burns calories)
    description: "Sprint 2 cells north (only works on Grid2D)"
    icon: "🏃"

# Notes:
# - REST enables gradual recovery without finding Bed
# - MEDITATE provides mood boost without social interaction
# - TELEPORT_HOME creates economic choice (expensive but saves time)
# - SPRINT is Grid2D-specific (won't work on Grid3D or GridND)
#   This demonstrates that operators can define substrate-specific actions
#   Permissive semantics: invalid deltas fail at runtime, not config validation
