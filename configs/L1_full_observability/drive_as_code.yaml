# drive_as_code.yaml - Drive As Code (DAC) Reward Configuration
# L1_full_observability: Full Observability Baseline
#
# Reward Strategy: Multiplicative (energy × health)
# - Extrinsic: r_ext = 1.0 * energy * health
# - Intrinsic: RND novelty-seeking (base_weight = 1.0)
# - Composition: r_total = r_ext + (intrinsic_weight * r_int)
#
# Pedagogical Goal: Full observability baseline with multiplicative reward
# Teaching Moment: "Low Energy Delirium" bug present (no crisis suppression)
# Note: Higher intrinsic weight (1.0) encourages exploration in full observability
