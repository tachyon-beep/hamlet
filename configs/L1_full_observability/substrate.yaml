# Substrate Configuration for Level 1: Full Observability Baseline
#
# Standard 8×8 grid with all 14 affordances. Agent sees complete grid
# (full observability). Baseline for comparing POMDP performance.
#
# Level 1 characteristics:
# - All affordances deployed (14 total)
# - Complete grid visibility (no POMDP)
# - Standard MLP Q-network (~26K params)
# - Baseline survival metrics for curriculum progression
