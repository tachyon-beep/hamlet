# Action Labels Configuration - Custom Submarine Example
#
# Custom marine terminology for submarine navigation.
# Demonstrates how to create domain-specific labels for specialized contexts.
# Use for: Marine contexts, custom domains, specialized training

# Custom labels: Dictionary mapping action indices to labels
# Must specify all 8 canonical actions (0-7)
custom:
  0: "PORT"       # Move left (port side in marine terminology)
  1: "STARBOARD"  # Move right (starboard side in marine terminology)
  2: "AFT"        # Move backward (toward stern)
  3: "FORE"       # Move forward (toward bow)
  4: "INTERACT"   # Interact with object
  5: "WAIT"       # Hold position
  6: "SURFACE"    # Move up (toward surface)
  7: "DIVE"       # Move down (dive deeper)

# Note: Label indices are automatically remapped based on substrate dimensionality:
#   - Aspatial (0D): {0: INTERACT, 1: WAIT} (2 actions)
#   - 1D: {0: PORT, 1: STARBOARD, 2: INTERACT, 3: WAIT} (4 actions)
#   - 2D: {0: FORE, 1: AFT, 2: PORT, 3: STARBOARD, 4: INTERACT, 5: WAIT} (6 actions)
#   - 3D: {0: FORE, 1: AFT, 2: PORT, 3: STARBOARD, 4: INTERACT, 5: WAIT, 6: SURFACE, 7: DIVE} (8 actions)
#
# Custom label guidelines:
#   - Keys must be integers 0-7 (canonical action indices)
#   - Values must be non-empty strings
#   - All 8 actions must be specified (even if substrate only uses subset)
#   - Labels are automatically filtered to substrate's action space
#
# Examples of other custom domains:
#   - Aviation: ROLL_LEFT, ROLL_RIGHT, PITCH_UP, PITCH_DOWN, YAW_LEFT, YAW_RIGHT
#   - Medical: PROXIMAL, DISTAL, ANTERIOR, POSTERIOR, SUPERIOR, INFERIOR
#   - Architecture: NORTH_WING, SOUTH_WING, EAST_WING, WEST_WING, UPPER_FLOOR, LOWER_FLOOR
#
# Pedagogical value:
#   - Demonstrates arbitrary nature of labels (semantics > syntax)
#   - Enables domain-appropriate learning contexts
#   - Shows how same math operations map to different terminology
