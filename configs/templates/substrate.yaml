# Substrate Configuration - TEMPLATE
#
# Copy this file into your config pack directory and customize the values.
#
# UNIVERSE_AS_CODE Principle:
# All spatial parameters must be explicitly specified. No hidden defaults allowed.
# This ensures reproducible configs and operator awareness of all behavioral parameters.
#
# Config Pack Structure:
# Every config pack should include these files:
#   - substrate.yaml    (this file - spatial substrate definition)
#   - bars.yaml         (meter definitions: energy, health, satiation, etc.)
#   - cascades.yaml     (cascade physics: meter interactions)
#   - affordances.yaml  (interaction definitions: Bed, Job, Hospital, etc.)
#   - training.yaml     (training hyperparameters and network config)
#   - cues.yaml         (optional - UI metadata for visualization)

# Human-readable description of this substrate configuration
# Should explain: grid size, boundary type, distance metric, intended use
description: "REPLACE_WITH_DESCRIPTION (e.g., '8×8 square grid for my custom level')"

# Substrate type: "grid" (spatial with positioning) or "aspatial" (pure state machine)
#
# "grid": Agents have positions on 2D grid, navigate via movement actions
# "aspatial": No positions, agents interact with affordances directly (no navigation)
type: "grid"  # Options: "grid", "aspatial"

# Grid substrate configuration (REQUIRED if type="grid", omit if type="aspatial")
grid:
  # Topology: Type of grid coordinate system
  # Currently only "square" (standard 2D Cartesian grid) is supported
  # Future: "hexagonal", "triangular", "3d_cube" (reserved for future use)
  topology: "square"

  # Grid dimensions (REQUIRED, must be positive integers)
  # width: Number of columns (x-axis, 0 to width-1)
  # height: Number of rows (y-axis, 0 to height-1)
  #
  # Current implementation: Non-square grids (width ≠ height) are supported
  # but uncommon. Most curriculum levels use square grids.
  #
  # Observation dimension impact: grid encoding uses width × height dimensions
  # Example: 8×8 grid = 64 dims, 3×3 grid = 9 dims
  width: 8
  height: 8

  # Boundary behavior: What happens when agent tries to move outside grid
  # Options:
  #   - "clamp": Hard walls - position clamped to grid edges (agent stays at edge)
  #   - "wrap": Toroidal wraparound - agent wraps to opposite edge (Pac-Man style)
  #   - "bounce": Elastic reflection - agent reflects back from boundary
  #   - "sticky": Sticky walls - agent stays in place when hitting boundary
  #
  # Behavioral implications:
  #   - "clamp": Agent learns edges exist, corners are dead ends
  #   - "wrap": Infinite grid feel, shortest path may cross edges
  #   - "bounce": Agent bounces back, reflects across boundary
  #   - "sticky": Similar to clamp but different semantics (stays in place vs clamped)
  #
  # Most curriculum levels use "clamp" for clear spatial boundaries.
  boundary: "clamp"

  # Distance metric: How to measure distance between two positions
  # Options:
  #   - "manhattan": L1 norm, |x1-x2| + |y1-y2| (sum of absolute differences)
  #   - "euclidean": L2 norm, sqrt((x1-x2)² + (y1-y2)²) (straight-line distance)
  #   - "chebyshev": L∞ norm, max(|x1-x2|, |y1-y2|) (max of differences)
  #
  # Behavioral implications:
  #   - "manhattan": Only cardinal movement, diagonal distance = x + y steps
  #                  Example: [0,0] to [3,4] = 7 steps
  #                  Natural for grid worlds with 4-directional movement
  #   - "euclidean": Considers diagonal shortcuts, diagonal distance < manhattan
  #                  Example: [0,0] to [3,4] = 5.0 steps
  #                  More realistic for spatial reasoning, but doesn't match movement mechanics
  #   - "chebyshev": Diagonal = 1 step (8-directional movement)
  #                  Example: [0,0] to [3,4] = 4 steps
  #                  Natural for games with diagonal movement
  #
  # Most curriculum levels use "manhattan" to match 4-directional movement.
  distance_metric: "manhattan"

# Aspatial substrate configuration (REQUIRED if type="aspatial", omit if type="grid")
#
# Aspatial universes have NO positioning - agents exist in pure state space.
# Affordances are available without navigation. Reveals that meters are the
# true universe - positioning is just an optional overlay.
#
# Use cases:
#   - Pure resource management (no spatial planning)
#   - Baseline for comparing spatial vs aspatial learning
#   - Pedagogical: Show that substrate is OPTIONAL
#
# Uncomment if using aspatial mode:
# aspatial: {}

# Examples and Pedagogical Notes:
#
# Standard Grid (Most Common):
#   type: grid
#   grid: {topology: square, width: 8, height: 8, boundary: clamp, distance_metric: manhattan}
#   Use for: Standard curriculum levels, spatial planning
#
# Toroidal Grid (Wraparound):
#   type: grid
#   grid: {topology: square, width: 8, height: 8, boundary: wrap, distance_metric: manhattan}
#   Use for: Pac-Man style worlds, infinite grid feel
#
# Euclidean Distance (Diagonal-Aware):
#   type: grid
#   grid: {topology: square, width: 8, height: 8, boundary: clamp, distance_metric: euclidean}
#   Use for: Comparing distance metrics, realistic spatial reasoning
#
# Aspatial (No Positioning):
#   type: aspatial
#   aspatial: {}
#   Use for: Pure resource management, baseline comparison
#
# Pedagogical Value:
# Changing ONE parameter (boundary, distance_metric) dramatically alters gameplay.
# Students learn how spatial abstractions shape agent behavior.
