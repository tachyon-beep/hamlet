# drive_as_code.yaml - Drive As Code (DAC) Reward Configuration
# L0_0_minimal: Temporal Credit Assignment
#
# Reward Strategy: Multiplicative (energy only)
# - Extrinsic: r_ext = 1.0 * energy
# - Intrinsic: RND novelty-seeking (base_weight = 0.1)
# - Composition: r_total = r_ext + (intrinsic_weight * r_int)
#
# Pedagogical Goal: Teach temporal credit assignment with single resource
# Teaching Moment: "Low Energy Delirium" bug present (no crisis suppression)
