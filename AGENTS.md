# Hamlet Project: AI Agent Memory Document

**Last Updated:** November 2, 2025  
**Purpose:** Comprehensive project documentation for AI assistants and future developers  
**Current Branch:** main  
**Test Coverage:** 62% (376 tests passing after legacy code removal)  
**Authority Order:** ROADMAP.md > actual code > CLAUDE.md (CLAUDE.md is outdated)  
**Package Manager:** Use `uv` for all pip operations

---

## Executive Summary

Hamlet is a **pedagogical Deep Reinforcement Learning environment** designed to "trick students into learning graduate-level RL by making them think they're just playing The Sims." Agents learn to survive in a grid world by managing 8 interconnected meters (energy, hygiene, satiation, money, mood, social, health, fitness) through interactions with 15 affordances.

### Current Status: Phase 3 Complete + Legacy Cleanup Complete, Phase 3.5 Next

**Phase 3 (✅ COMPLETE - Nov 2, 2025):** Full Config-Driven Architecture

- ✅ **CascadeEngine Integration:** Removed 148 lines of legacy meter dynamics (Nov 2)
- ✅ **AffordanceEngine Migration:** Removed 282 lines of legacy affordance code (Nov 2)
- ✅ **Total Technical Debt Eliminated:** 430 lines + 11 obsolete tests
- ✅ **Single Source of Truth:** All systems now YAML-driven (bars.yaml, cascades.yaml, affordances_corrected.yaml)
- ✅ **RND Exploration:** Random Network Distillation with adaptive annealing
- ✅ **Adversarial Curriculum:** 5-stage progressive difficulty system
- ✅ **376 tests passing** (100% pass rate after cleanup)

**Phase 3.5 (🎯 NEXT):** Multi-Day Tech Demo

- Validate system stability over 48+ hours (10K episodes)
- Observe exploration→exploitation transition in production
- Generate teaching materials from real training data
- **Purpose:** Validate foundation before adding POMDP complexity
- **Status:** READY - all legacy code removed, systems validated

**Strategic Direction:** 2→3→1 approach

- Multi-Day Demo (validate) → POMDP Extension (add complexity) → Informed Optimization (profile real system)
- **Rationale:** Avoid optimizing twice by waiting until POMDP reveals real bottlenecks

### Key Features

- **Config-driven architecture** - All game mechanics defined in YAML files (Nov 2)
- **Vectorized GPU training** with PyTorch tensors throughout
- **Adversarial curriculum learning** (5 progressive stages from shaped to sparse rewards)
- **RND-based intrinsic motivation** with adaptive annealing
- **Partial observability (POMDP)** support with recurrent neural networks (Level 2 implemented)
- **Temporal mechanics** with time-of-day cycles and multi-tick interactions (Level 3 implemented)
- **Unified server** for training + inference in single process

**Recent Milestone:** MAJOR REFACTORING COMPLETE (Nov 2, 2025)

- ✅ **CascadeEngine:** meter_dynamics.py 315→167 lines, pure config-driven
- ✅ **AffordanceEngine:** Removed AFFORDANCE_CONFIGS dict (240 lines)
- ✅ **vectorized_env.py:** All 3 code paths migrated to use AffordanceEngine
- ✅ **Deleted obsolete tests:** 11 tests removed (8 cascade + 3 affordance)
- ✅ **Training validated:** 10 episodes successful with new architecture
- Major refactoring plan documented with 15 actions in `docs/testing/REFACTORING_ACTIONS.md`

## Project Structure & Entry Points

### ⚠️ Critical: Active vs Legacy Code

**ACTIVE SYSTEM:** `src/townlet/` - All development happens here  
**LEGACY (DO NOT EDIT):** `src/hamlet/` - Obsolete code, will be deleted  
**Exception:** `src/hamlet/demo/runner.py` - Temporary entry point (will move to `townlet/training/`)

### Running the System

**✅ Current: Unified Server (Training + Inference in one command)**

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start training + inference server
python run_demo.py --config configs/level_1_full_observability.yaml --episodes 10000

# Terminal 2: Start frontend (Vue dev server - optional, for visualization)
cd frontend && npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:5173

# Terminal 3: Start TensorBoard (optional, for metrics visualization)
tensorboard --logdir runs/L1_full_observability/<timestamp>/tensorboard
# Open http://localhost:6006

# Note: The unified server will print the exact commands for you!
```

**What You'll See When Starting:**

```

## Core Components Deep Dive

### 1. Environment (`vectorized_env.py`) - 433 lines - **HIGHEST RISK**

**Complexity Level:** 🔴 EXTREME  
**Coverage:** 82% (356/433 statements)  
**Refactoring Priority:** CRITICAL

#### Responsibilities (Too Many!)

1. **Grid Management** - Agent positions, affordance locations
2. **Meter System** - 8-meter differential equations with cascading effects
3. **Observation Construction** - Full vs partial observability modes
4. **Action Execution** - Movement, interaction, action masking
5. **Temporal Mechanics** - Time-of-day cycles, multi-tick interactions
6. **Reward Calculation** - Milestone bonuses, shaped rewards (complex, mostly disabled)
7. **Terminal Conditions** - Death conditions, cascading meter failures

#### Key Methods

**Reset & Observation (Lines 1-230)**

```python
def reset() -> torch.Tensor
def _get_observations() -> torch.Tensor
def _get_full_observations() -> torch.Tensor  # Level 1: full grid
def _get_partial_observations() -> torch.Tensor  # Level 2 POMDP: 5x5 window
def _get_current_affordance_encoding() -> torch.Tensor  # One-hot affordances
```

**Action System (Lines 230-400)**

```python
def get_action_masks() -> torch.Tensor  # Boundary + affordability checks
def step(actions) -> Tuple[obs, rewards, dones, info]
def _execute_actions(actions) -> dict  # Movement + INTERACT
def _handle_interactions(interact_mask) -> dict  # Multi-tick mechanics
def _handle_interactions_legacy(interact_mask) -> dict  # Single-shot fallback
```

**Meter Dynamics (Lines 700-950) - CASCADING DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS**

```python
def _deplete_meters() -> None  # Base passive decay
def _apply_secondary_to_primary_effects() -> None  # Satiation/Fitness/Mood → Health/Energy
def _apply_tertiary_to_secondary_effects() -> None  # Hygiene/Social → Satiation/Fitness/Mood
def _apply_tertiary_to_primary_effects() -> None  # Hygiene/Social → Health/Energy (weak)
def _check_dones() -> None  # Death conditions
```

**Reward System (Lines 950-1150)**

```python
def _calculate_shaped_rewards() -> torch.Tensor  # Milestone bonuses (ACTIVE)
def _calculate_shaped_rewards_COMPLEX_DISABLED() -> torch.Tensor  # Per-step meter rewards (DISABLED - caused negative accumulation)
def _calculate_proximity_rewards() -> torch.Tensor  # Proximity shaping (DISABLED - reward hacking)
```

#### Meter System Architecture

**PRIMARY (Death Conditions):**

- `health` [6]: Are you alive?
- `energy` [0]: Can you move?

**SECONDARY (Strong → Primary):**

- `satiation` [2] → health AND energy (FUNDAMENTAL - affects both!)
- `fitness` [7] → health (unfit → sick → death)
- `mood` [4] → energy (depressed → exhausted → death)

**TERTIARY (Quality of Life):**

- `hygiene` [1] → secondary (strong) + primary (weak)
- `social` [5] → secondary (strong) + primary (weak)

**RESOURCE:**

- `money` [3]: Enables affordances ($0-$100 = 0.0-1.0 normalized)

#### Refactoring Opportunities

**Option A: Vertical Slice by Feature**

```
environment/
├── core/              # Grid, positions, observations
├── meters/            # Meter dynamics, cascading effects
├── actions/           # Movement, interactions, masking
├── rewards/           # Reward calculation strategies
└── temporal/          # Time-based mechanics
```

**Option B: Horizontal Slice by Concern**

```
environment/
├── state.py           # Environment state management
├── dynamics.py        # Meter differential equations
├── interactions.py    # Affordance interaction logic
├── observations.py    # Observation construction
└── rewards.py         # Reward strategies
```

**Recommendation:** Start with extracting `RewardStrategy` and `MeterDynamics` classes - they're most isolated.

### 1a. CascadeEngine (`environment/cascade_engine.py`) - 305 lines ✨ NEW

**Coverage:** 100% (21/21 tests passing)  
**Risk Level:** 🟢 LOW (fully tested, config-driven)  
**Status:** ✅ READY FOR INTEGRATION (Nov 1, 2025)

#### Purpose

Config-driven cascade system that replaces hardcoded meter dynamics logic. Enables students to experiment with different cascade physics by editing YAML files instead of Python code.

#### Configuration Files

**bars.yaml (109 lines):**

- 8 meter definitions with base depletion rates
- Terminal conditions (health <= 0 OR energy <= 0)
- Note: health base_depletion = 0.0 (handled by fitness modulation)

**cascades.yaml (198 lines):**

- 1 modulation: fitness→health (0.5x-3.0x multiplier)
- 10 threshold cascades with gradient penalties
- Execution order: modulations → primary_to_pivotal → secondary_to_primary → secondary_to_pivotal_weak
- All cascades use 30% thresholds

#### Architecture

```python
class CascadeEngine:
    def __init__(config: EnvironmentConfig, device: torch.device):
        # Pre-build lookup maps and tensors for GPU performance
        self._bar_name_to_idx: Dict[str, int]
        self._base_depletions: torch.Tensor[8]
        self._cascade_data: Dict[str, List[CascadeInfo]]  # By category
        
    def apply_base_depletions(meters) -> meters:
        # Subtract base_depletions tensor, clamp [0,1]
        
    def apply_modulations(meters) -> meters:
        # Fitness → health multiplier (0.5x healthy, 3.0x unfit)
        
    def apply_threshold_cascades(meters, categories) -> meters:
        # Gradient penalty cascades by category
        # penalty = strength * (threshold - source) / threshold
        
    def check_terminal_conditions(meters, dones) -> dones:
        # Death detection (health <= 0 OR energy <= 0)
        
    def apply_full_cascade(meters) -> meters:
        # Complete sequence per execution_order
```

#### Gradient Penalty Math

```python
# When source < threshold (0.3):
deficit = (threshold - source) / threshold  # Normalized [0,1]
penalty = strength * deficit
target -= penalty

# Example: satiation=0.2, threshold=0.3, strength=0.004
deficit = (0.3 - 0.2) / 0.3 = 0.333
penalty = 0.004 * 0.333 = 0.00133
```

#### Integration Status

**✅ Equivalence Verified:** CascadeEngine produces identical results to hardcoded MeterDynamics

- 44/44 tests passing (23 config + 21 engine)
- Tested: healthy agents, low satiation, gradient penalties, modulations, terminal conditions
- **Next Step:** Replace hardcoded logic in MeterDynamics, run full 275-test suite

#### Teaching Value

- Students can experiment with cascade strengths by editing YAML
- Alternative configs available: weak_cascades.yaml, strong_cascades.yaml, sdw_official.yaml
- "Interesting failures" when cascades too weak (death) or too strong (can't recover)
- Demonstrates data-driven system design vs hardcoded logic

---

### 2. Neural Networks (`agent/networks.py`) - 217 lines

**Coverage:** 98%  
**Risk Level:** � LOW (well-tested)

#### Architectures

**SimpleQNetwork (Lines 8-30)**

- MLP: `[obs_dim → 128 → 128 → action_dim]`
- For full observability (Level 1)
- Used when `partial_observability=False`

**RecurrentSpatialQNetwork (Lines 33-217)**

- For partial observability (Level 2 POMDP)
- Components:
  - Vision Encoder: CNN `[5×5 window → 128 features]`
  - Position Encoder: MLP `[x,y → 32 features]`
  - Meter Encoder: MLP `[8 meters → 32 features]`
  - Affordance Encoder: MLP `[15 types → 32 features]`
  - LSTM: `[224 → 256 hidden]`
  - Q-Head: MLP `[256 → 128 → action_dim]`
- Stateful: Maintains hidden state across episode

#### Critical Methods

```python
def forward(obs, hidden=None) -> (q_values, new_hidden)
def reset_hidden_state(batch_size, device) -> None
def set_hidden_state(hidden) -> None
def get_hidden_state() -> Optional[Tuple[h, c]]
```

#### Testing Status

1. ✅ Shape validation (input/output dimensions) - TESTED
2. ✅ Hidden state management (reset, continuity) - TESTED
3. ✅ Batch processing - TESTED
4. ⚠️ LSTM memory (does it actually use history?) - ACTION #9 will address

---

### 3. Curriculum (`curriculum/adversarial.py`) - 360 lines

**Coverage:** 86%  
**Risk Level:** � LOW (well-tested)  
**Complexity:** State machine with performance tracking

#### 5-Stage Progression

```python
Stage 1: Basic needs (energy, hygiene) @ 20% depletion - SHAPED
Stage 2: + hunger @ 50% depletion - SHAPED
Stage 3: + money @ 80% depletion - SHAPED
Stage 4: All meters @ 100% depletion - SHAPED
Stage 5: All meters @ 100% depletion - SPARSE ← GRADUATION!
```

#### Advancement Logic (Lines 185-210)

Agent advances when:

- Survival rate > 70%
- Learning progress > 0 (reward improvement)
- Entropy < 0.5 (policy converged)
- Min 1000 steps at current stage

Agent retreats when:

- Survival rate < 30%
- Negative learning progress

#### Key Classes

**PerformanceTracker (Lines 60-100)**

```python
episode_rewards: torch.Tensor[num_agents]
episode_steps: torch.Tensor[num_agents]
prev_avg_reward: torch.Tensor[num_agents]
agent_stages: torch.Tensor[num_agents]  # 1-5
steps_at_stage: torch.Tensor[num_agents]

def update_step(rewards, dones) -> None
def get_survival_rate(max_steps) -> torch.Tensor
def get_learning_progress() -> torch.Tensor
```

**AdversarialCurriculum (Lines 103-360)**

```python
def initialize_population(num_agents) -> None
def _should_advance(agent_idx, entropy) -> bool
def _should_retreat(agent_idx) -> bool
def get_batch_decisions_with_qvalues(agent_states, agent_ids, q_values) -> List[CurriculumDecision]
def _calculate_action_entropy(q_values) -> torch.Tensor
def state_dict() -> Dict  # For checkpointing
def load_state_dict(state_dict) -> None
```

#### Testing Status

1. ✅ Stage progression logic - TESTED
2. ✅ Entropy calculation - TESTED
3. ✅ Survival rate tracking - TESTED
4. ✅ State persistence (checkpointing) - TESTED

### 4. Exploration (`exploration/` module)

**Coverage:** 100% on main modules (epsilon_greedy, adaptive_intrinsic)  
**Risk Level:** 🟢 LOW (well-abstracted)#### Class Hierarchy

```
ExplorationStrategy (base.py - Abstract)
├── EpsilonGreedyExploration (epsilon_greedy.py)
│   └── Simple ε-greedy with exponential decay
├── RNDExploration (rnd.py)
│   ├── Fixed Network (random, frozen)
│   ├── Predictor Network (trained)
│   └── Intrinsic Reward = Prediction Error
└── AdaptiveIntrinsicExploration (adaptive_intrinsic.py)
    ├── Wraps RNDExploration (composition)
    └── Variance-based annealing of intrinsic weight
```

#### Key Interface (base.py)

```python
@abstractmethod
def select_actions(q_values, agent_states, action_masks) -> torch.Tensor
@abstractmethod
def compute_intrinsic_rewards(observations) -> torch.Tensor
@abstractmethod
def update(batch: Dict[str, torch.Tensor]) -> None
@abstractmethod
def checkpoint_state() -> Dict[str, Any]
@abstractmethod
def load_state(state: Dict[str, Any]) -> None
```

#### RND Details (rnd.py)

```python
RNDNetwork: 3-layer MLP [obs_dim → 256 → 128 → embed_dim]

Fixed Network: Random weights, frozen
Predictor Network: Trained to match fixed network
Intrinsic Reward: MSE(fixed, predictor) per observation
Training: Mini-batch (128) accumulation, then update
```

#### Adaptive Annealing (adaptive_intrinsic.py)

```python
Tracks survival_history: List[float] (window=100)
Anneals intrinsic_weight when:
  - variance < threshold (10.0 → 100.0 to prevent premature annealing)
  - mean_survival > 50 steps (must be succeeding, not just consistent)
Decay: weight *= 0.99 (exponential)
```

#### Testing Priorities

1. ✅ Action selection with masking
2. ✅ RND prediction error calculation
3. ✅ Variance-based annealing triggers
4. ✅ State persistence

## Key Design Patterns

### 1. Vectorized Operations

**Everything is batched `[num_agents, ...]` tensors on GPU**

```python
# Good: Vectorized
rewards = torch.where(dones, -100.0, rewards)

# Bad: Python loops
for i in range(num_agents):
    if dones[i]:
        rewards[i] = -100.0
```

### 2. Hot Path vs Cold Path

```python
# Hot Path (GPU, every step): PyTorch tensors, no validation
class BatchedAgentState:
    __slots__ = ['observations', 'actions', ...]  # Memory efficient

# Cold Path (CPU, per episode): Pydantic models, validation
class CurriculumDecision(BaseModel):
    difficulty_level: float = Field(ge=0.0, le=1.0)  # Validated
```

### 3. Composition over Inheritance

```python
# AdaptiveIntrinsicExploration wraps RNDExploration
self.rnd = RNDExploration(...)  # Composition
self.current_intrinsic_weight = 1.0  # Added behavior
```

### 4. Action Masking for Exploration Efficiency

```python
action_masks = env.get_action_masks()  # [batch, 5] bool
masked_q_values = q_values.clone()
masked_q_values[~action_masks] = float('-inf')  # Prevent invalid actions
actions = masked_q_values.argmax(dim=1)
```

---

## Known Issues & Gotchas

### 1. Recurrent Network Hidden State Management

**Problem:** Hidden state must be carefully managed across:

- Episode resets (zero out for terminated agents)
- Batch training (treat transitions independently)
- Multi-agent rollouts (separate state per agent)

**Current Implementation:** Lines 330-352 in `vectorized.py`

```python
# Episode reset: Zero out hidden state for done agents
h, c = self.q_network.get_hidden_state()
h[:, reset_indices, :] = 0.0
c[:, reset_indices, :] = 0.0
self.q_network.set_hidden_state((h, c))
```

### 2. Money Normalization Confusion

**Two Systems Coexist:**

- **Temporal Mechanics:** `cost_per_tick` in config (already normalized)
- **Legacy:** `affordance_costs_dollars` in code (needs conversion)

**Normalization:** `$100 = 1.0`, `$0 = 0.0` (no debt allowed)

### 3. Reward Calculation Evolution

**Three Generations:**

1. **COMPLEX_DISABLED** (Lines 1000-1150): Per-step meter rewards → negative accumulation bug
2. **Proximity Shaping** (Lines 1150-1230): Reward nearness → hacking (standing near affordances)
3. **Milestone Bonuses** (Lines 950-1000): Current system, sparse survival bonuses

**Current Active:** Milestone system only  
**Pedagogical Value:** Proximity hacking demonstrates specification gaming and reward hacking

### 4. Temporal Mechanics Interaction Progress

**State:** `interaction_progress[agent_idx]` tracks ticks completed
**Reset Triggers:**

- Agent moves away from affordance
- Completes full interaction (reaches `required_ticks`)

**Bug Risk:** Progress not reset when affordance becomes unavailable (closed hours)

### 5. Affordance Operating Hours Wraparound

**Midnight Wraparound:**

- Bar: `(18, 4)` = 6pm to 4am (crosses midnight)
- Logic: `time >= open_tick OR time < close_tick`

**Testing Critical:** Edge cases at 0, 23, 24 hour boundaries

### 6. Intrinsic Weight Annealing (FIXED 2025-10-30)

**Previous Bug:** Premature annealing caused by low variance threshold (10.0)

- Agents that "consistently failed" (low variance, low survival) would trigger annealing
- Annealing should only happen when "consistently succeeding"

**Current Fix:**

- Variance threshold: 10.0 → 100.0
- New requirement: mean_survival > 50 steps before annealing
- Prevents "consistently failing" from being confused with "consistent performance"

### 7. Network Architecture Auto-Detection

**Critical:** Observation dimension varies by configuration:

- Full observability: grid_size² + 8 meters = 72 dims (8×8 grid)
- Partial observability: (2*vision_range+1)² + 2 (position) + 8 = 35 dims (5×5 window)
- Temporal mechanics: +2 dims (time_of_day + interaction_progress)

**Do NOT hardcode obs_dim** - always auto-detect from environment:

```python
obs_dim = env.observation_dim  # Let environment calculate based on config
```

---

## Performance Characteristics

### GPU Utilization

- **Good:** Meter updates, action execution, observation construction
- **Bottleneck:** Q-network training (64-batch every 4 steps)
- **CPU Fallback:** Curriculum decisions (per-episode, acceptable)

### Training Speed

- **Target:** ~200 episodes/hour on GPU
- **Actual:** Varies by survival time (longer episodes = slower)
- **Checkpoint Overhead:** Every 100 episodes (~1 second save)

### Memory Usage

- **Replay Buffer:** 10K transitions × obs_dim × 4 bytes
- **Network Weights:** ~500KB (SimpleQNetwork), ~2MB (RecurrentSpatialQNetwork)
- **Batch State:** num_agents × obs_dim × 4 bytes (usually <1MB)

---

## Configuration Management

### Training Config (YAML)

  entropy_gate: 0.5

exploration:
  initial_intrinsic_weight: 1.0
  variance_threshold: 100.0
  survival_window: 100
```

### Device Selection

## Roadmap & Future Development

### Phase 3.5: Multi-Day Tech Demo (🎯 IMMEDIATE)

**Goal:** Validate Phase 3 system over 48+ hours of continuous training

**Success Criteria:**

- Training runs 10K episodes without crashes
- Intrinsic weight anneals from 1.0 → <0.1
- Agent progresses through all 5 curriculum stages
- Final survival time > 200 steps (vs ~115 baseline)
- No memory leaks or performance degradation

**Deliverables:**

- Training logs and metrics
- Screenshots of exploration→exploitation transition
- Teaching materials from real data

**Estimated Duration:** 2-3 days runtime + 1 day setup/monitoring

### Phase 4: POMDP Extension (📋 PLANNED)

**Goal:** Add partial observability and working memory

**Why After Demo:** Validates Phase 3 foundation before adding complexity

**Core Changes:**

- Partial observability: 5×5 vision window (already implemented)
- LSTM memory for sequential reasoning (already implemented)
- Modified reward shaping for hidden affordance discovery
- New testing for hidden state propagation

**Teaching Value:**

- Demonstrates working memory requirements
- Shows partial observability effects on exploration
- Creates "interesting failures" when agents forget locations
- Introduces recurrent architectures

**Note:** Don't optimize during this phase - focus on correctness

### Phase 5: Informed Optimization (📋 PLANNED)

**Goal:** Profile complete system and optimize based on real bottlenecks

**Why Last:** Avoids 1→3→1 trap (optimizing twice)

**Optimization Candidates:**

- Target Network for DQN stability
- Double DQN to reduce overestimation
- Dueling Architecture (value/advantage separation)
- GPU optimization (fix RND CPU transfers)
- LSTM gradient flow tuning
- Sequential replay buffer for recurrent training

**Process:**

1. Profile with cProfile, PyTorch profiler
2. Identify actual bottlenecks (not guesses)
3. Prioritize by impact
4. Validate correctness after each change

**Target:** 2-5x speedup (100 → 200-500 episodes/hour)

### Phase 6: Multi-Agent Competition (📋 FUTURE)

**Goal:** Add competitive multi-agent scenarios

**Concepts:**

- Agents compete for limited resources
- Theory of mind: predict other agents' actions
- Emergent cooperation or competition
- Communication (implicit via observation)

**Teaching Value:** Game theory, social intelligence, emergent behavior

### Phase 7: Emergent Communication (📋 FUTURE)

**Goal:** Family units with emergent language

**Concepts:**

- Family members share information
- Discrete symbol communication channel
- Emergent protocols for coordination
- Language grounding in shared experience

### North Star: Social Hamlet 🌟

**The Ultimate Vision (2-3 years):**

**Environment:**

- 50×50 grid (vs current 8×8)
- Dozens of agents simultaneously
- Continuous affordance usage (blocking mechanics)
- Multiple instances of each affordance type
- Dynamic environment (affordances move/appear/disappear)

**Emergent Behaviors:**

- Strategic competition: "Agent A notices Agent B's routine and adapts"
- Social penalties: proximity costs create natural territoriality
- Economic hierarchy: tiered housing, job competition
- Emergent cooperation patterns despite individual incentives

**Teaching Value:**

- Nash equilibria emerge naturally
- Social intelligence and theory of mind
- Temporal strategy (planning ahead)
- Resource allocation and market dynamics
- Conflict resolution behaviors

**Why Document This Now:** Every phase builds toward this vision. Knowing the endstate helps avoid premature abstraction while keeping doors open (the "for but not with" principle).

## Glossary

**POMDP:** Partially Observable Markov Decision Process - agent sees local window, not full grid  
**RND:** Random Network Distillation - novelty-based intrinsic motivation  
**DQN:** Deep Q-Network - value-based RL algorithm  
**Vectorized:** Batched operations on `[num_agents, ...]` tensors for GPU efficiency  
**Hot Path:** Code executed every step (must be GPU-optimized)  
**Cold Path:** Code executed per episode (CPU validation acceptable)  
**Action Masking:** Prevent invalid actions (boundary violations, unaffordable affordances)  
**Curriculum:** Progressive difficulty increase based on agent performance  
**Sparse Rewards:** Only reward at terminal states (vs shaped rewards every step)  
**Affordance:** Interactable object that modifies agent meters

## Contact & Contribution

**Project Owner:** <john@example.com>  
**Repository:** tachyon-beep/hamlet  
**Branch Strategy:** `main` (direct commits), feature branches for major changes  
**PR Requirements:** Tests must pass, coverage should not decrease  

**Before Major Refactoring:**

1. Read this document fully
2. Run coverage analysis: `uv run pytest --cov=src/townlet --cov-report=term-missing`
3. Identify untested code paths
4. Write characterization tests for current behavior
5. Refactor with tests green at each step
6. Re-run coverage to ensure no regression

## Important Notes on Documentation

**Authority Order:** ROADMAP.md > actual code > CLAUDE.md

**CLAUDE.md Status:** Outdated in several areas:

- Says "Townlet" is ONLY active system (correct, but details outdated)
- References old entry point locations (some consolidated)
- Some architecture details need updating
- Configs section partially outdated
- **Still useful for:** Command examples, general philosophy, known pitfalls

**This Document (AGENTS.md):** Synthesizes ROADMAP.md (strategic direction), actual code (ground truth), and relevant parts of CLAUDE.md. When in doubt, check ROADMAP.md first, then verify against actual code.

**Pedagogical Mission:** "Trick students into learning graduate-level RL by making them think they're just playing The Sims." This principle guides all design decisions - interesting failures are teaching moments, not bugs to immediately fix.

---

**Remember:** At 64% coverage (241 tests passing), we have a solid foundation. Target 70% before major refactoring. Quick wins available: Remove 216 lines of dead code (ACTION #13) for instant coverage boost!
