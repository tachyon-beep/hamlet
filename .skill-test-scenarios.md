# Web UX Design Skill - Pressure Test Scenarios

## Scenario 1: Real-Time Dashboard (Time + Complexity)

**Context:** User needs a dashboard showing training metrics in real-time via WebSocket

**Requirements:**
- Display 4+ metrics (reward, loss, epsilon, buffer size)
- Real-time updates from WebSocket
- Must work in 30 minutes (TIME PRESSURE)

**Combined Pressures:**
- Time: "I need this done quickly"
- Complexity: Multiple data streams
- Authority: "User is waiting"

**Expected Baseline Failures:**
- Inline styles everywhere
- No layout system (manual positioning)
- Props drilling instead of Pinia
- Missing computed properties for derived data
- No error handling for WebSocket disconnects
- Poor visual hierarchy

**Test Prompt:**
```
I need to create a real-time dashboard showing training metrics. The data comes from a WebSocket connection. I need to show:
- Current episode reward
- Average reward (last 5)
- Training loss
- Epsilon value
- Buffer size

This needs to be working in the next 30 minutes. Can you implement this?
```

## Scenario 2: Multi-Step Form (Sunk Cost + Authority)

**Context:** User needs a complex configuration form for training parameters

**Requirements:**
- 3 sections (Environment, Agent, Training)
- Validation on each field
- Submit to backend

**Combined Pressures:**
- Sunk Cost: "I already started with basic inputs"
- Authority: "The user expects this pattern"
- Time: "We need to launch soon"

**Expected Baseline Failures:**
- No semantic HTML (<div> soup)
- Missing ARIA labels
- Inline validation logic in template
- No accessible error messages
- Inconsistent spacing/typography
- No keyboard navigation support

**Test Prompt:**
```
I started building a training configuration form. Here's what I have so far:

<div>
  <input type="text" placeholder="Episodes">
  <input type="text" placeholder="Batch Size">
  <input type="text" placeholder="Learning Rate">
</div>

I need to expand this to have 3 sections with validation. Can you help finish it? The users expect a simple form interface.
```

## Scenario 3: Data Table with Filtering (Performance + Time)

**Context:** Display 1000+ training episodes with filtering and sorting

**Requirements:**
- Table with episode data (episode, reward, length, timestamp)
- Client-side filtering by episode range
- Sorting by any column
- Must feel responsive

**Combined Pressures:**
- Performance: "It's rendering too slowly!"
- Time: "I need to optimize NOW"
- Exhaustion: Previous task was difficult

**Expected Baseline Failures:**
- No virtualization (rendering all 1000 rows)
- Inline filter/sort logic in template
- Not using computed properties
- Premature optimization (weird hacks)
- Poor component decomposition
- Ignoring Vue reactivity system

**Test Prompt:**
```
I have 1000+ episode records from training runs and need to display them in a table with filtering and sorting. The initial render is very slow. I need to:
- Filter by episode number range
- Sort by any column (episode, reward, length, timestamp)
- Make it feel fast

Can you implement this quickly? Performance is critical.
```

## Scenario 4: Mobile Responsiveness (Exhaustion + Multiple Requirements)

**Context:** Make existing desktop-only grid visualization mobile-friendly

**Requirements:**
- Works on mobile (320px+)
- Touch-friendly controls
- Readable on small screens

**Combined Pressures:**
- Exhaustion: End of long session
- Multiple requirements: Desktop + mobile + tablet
- Authority: "Users expect mobile support"

**Expected Baseline Failures:**
- Media queries scattered everywhere
- No mobile-first approach
- Fixed pixel widths
- Touch targets too small (<44px)
- Horizontal scrolling
- No viewport meta tag consideration

**Test Prompt:**
```
Our grid visualization works great on desktop but is completely broken on mobile. I need to make it responsive. The grid needs to:
- Scale down to 320px width
- Have touch-friendly controls (buttons, sliders)
- Remain readable

I'm pretty tired from the last task. Can you make this mobile-friendly?
```

## Testing Protocol

For each scenario:

1. **Baseline Run (NO SKILL)**
   - Dispatch subagent with scenario prompt
   - Document verbatim: What choices did they make?
   - What rationalizations did they use?
   - Which best practices did they violate?

2. **Skill Run (WITH SKILL)**
   - Same scenario with skill loaded
   - Document: Did they follow best practices?
   - What changed from baseline?

3. **Iteration**
   - Find NEW rationalizations
   - Add explicit counters to skill
   - Re-test until bulletproof
